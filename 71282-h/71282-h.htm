<h2 class="main">GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE MODERN CRIMINAL SCIENCE SERIES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the National Conference of Criminal Law and Criminology, held in Chicago, at Northwestern
University, in June, 1909, the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology
was organized; and, as a part of its work, the following resolution was passed:
</p>
<p>“<i>Whereas</i>, it is exceedingly desirable that important treatises on criminology in foreign languages
be made readily accessible in the English language, <i>Resolved</i>, that the president appoint a committee of five with power to select such treatises
as in their judgment should be translated, and to arrange for their publication.”
</p>
<p>The Committee appointed under this Resolution has made careful investigation of the
literature of the subject, and has consulted by frequent correspondence. It has selected
several works from among the mass of material. It has arranged with publisher, with
authors, and with translators, for the immediate undertaking and rapid progress of
the task. It realizes the necessity of educating the professions and the public by
the wide diffusion of information on this subject. It desires here to explain the
considerations which have moved it in seeking to select the treatises best adapted
to the purpose.
</p>
<p>For the community at large, it is important to recognize that criminal science is
a larger thing than criminal law. The legal profession in particular has a duty to
familiarize itself with the principles of that science, as the sole means for intelligent
and systematic improvement of the criminal law.
</p>
<p>Two centuries ago, while modern medical science was still young, medical practitioners
proceeded upon two general assumptions: one as to the cause of disease, the other
as to its treatment. As to the cause of disease,—disease was sent by the inscrutable
will of God. No man could fathom that will, nor its arbitrary operation. As to the
treatment of disease, there were believed to be a few remedial agents of universal
efficacy. Calomel and blood-letting, for example, were two of the principal ones.
A larger or <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>smaller dose of calomel, a greater or less quantity of bloodletting,—this blindly
indiscriminate mode of treatment was regarded as orthodox for all common varieties
of ailment. And so his calomel pill and his bloodletting lancet were carried everywhere
with him by the doctor.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, all this is past, in medical science. As to the causes of disease, we know
that they are facts of nature,—various, but distinguishable by diagnosis and research,
and more or less capable of prevention or control or counter-action. As to the treatment,
we now know that there are various specific modes of treatment for specific causes
or symptoms, and that the treatment must be adapted to the cause. In short, the individualization
of disease, in cause and in treatment, is the dominant truth of modern medical science.
</p>
<p>The same truth is now known about crime; but the understanding and the application
of it are just opening upon us. The old and still dominant thought is, as to cause,
that a crime is caused by the inscrutable moral free will of the human being, doing
or not doing the crime, just as it pleases; absolutely free in advance, at any moment
of time, to choose or not to choose the criminal act, and therefore in itself the
sole and ultimate cause of crime. As to treatment, there still are just two traditional
measures, used in varying doses for all kinds of crime and all kinds of persons,—jail,
or a fine (for death is now employed in rare cases only). But modern science, here
as in medicine, recognizes that crime also (like disease) has natural causes. It need
not be asserted for one moment that crime is a disease. But it does have natural causes,—that
is, circumstances which work to produce it in a given case. And as to treatment, modern
science recognizes that penal or remedial treatment cannot possibly be indiscriminate
and machine-like, but must be adapted to the causes, and to the man as affected by
those causes. Common sense and logic alike require, inevitably, that the moment we
predicate a specific cause for an undesirable effect, the remedial treatment must
be specifically adapted to that cause.
</p>
<p>Thus the great truth of the present and the future, for criminal science, is the individualization
of penal treatment,—for that man, and for the cause of that man’s crime.
</p>
<p>Now this truth opens up a vast field for re-examination. It means that we must study
all the possible data that can be causes of crime,—the man’s heredity, the man’s physical
and moral <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span>make-up, his emotional temperament, the surroundings of his youth, his present home,
and other conditions,—all the influencing circumstances. And it means that the effect
of different methods of treatment, old or new, for different kinds of men and of causes,
must be studied, experimented, and compared. Only in this way can accurate knowledge
be reached, and new efficient measures be adopted.
</p>
<p>All this has been going on in Europe for forty years past, and in limited fields in
this country. All the branches of science that can help have been working,—anthropology,
medicine, psychology, economics, sociology, philanthropy, penology. The law alone
has abstained. The science of law is the one to be served by all this. But the public
in general and the legal profession in particular have remained either ignorant of
the entire subject or indifferent to the entire scientific movement. And this ignorance
or indifference has blocked the way to progress in administration.
</p>
<p>The Institute therefore takes upon itself, as one of its aims, to inculcate the study
of modern criminal science, as a pressing duty for the legal profession and for the
thoughtful community at large. One of its principal modes of stimulating and aiding
this study is to make available in the English language the most useful treatises
now extant in the Continental languages. Our country has started late. There is much
to catch up with, in the results reached elsewhere. We shall, to be sure, profit by
the long period of argument and theorizing and experimentation which European thinkers
and workers have passed through. But to reap that profit, the results of their experience
must be made accessible in the English language.
</p>
<p>The effort, in selecting this series of translations, has been to choose those works
which best represent the various schools of thought in criminal science, the general
results reached, the points of contact or of controversy, and the contrasts of method—having
always in view that class of works which have a more than local value and could best
be serviceable to criminal science in our country. As the science has various aspects
and emphases—the anthropological, psychological, sociological, legal, statistical,
economic, pathological—due regard was paid, in the selection, to a representation
of all these aspects. And as the several Continental countries have contributed in
different ways to these various aspects,—France, Germany, Italy, most abundantly,
but the others each its share,—the effort was made also to recognize the different
contributions as far as feasible.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiv">[<a href="#pb.xiv">xiv</a>]</span></p>
<p>The selection made by the Committee, then, represents its judgment of the works that
are most useful and most instructive for the purpose of translation. It is its conviction
that this Series, when completed, will furnish the American student of criminal science
a systematic and sufficient acquaintance with the controlling doctrines and methods
that now hold the stage of thought in Continental Europe. Which of the various principles
and methods will prove best adapted to help our problems can only be told after our
students and workers have tested them in our own experience. But it is certain that
we must first acquaint ourselves with these results of a generation of European thought.
</p>
<p>In closing, the Committee thinks it desirable to refer the members of the Institute,
for purposes of further investigation of the literature, to the “Preliminary Bibliography
of Modern Criminal Law and Criminology” (Bulletin No. 1 of the Gary Library of Law
of Northwestern University), already issued to members of the Conference. The Committee
believes that some of the Anglo-American works listed therein will be found useful.

</p>
<p>Any adequate study of the phenomena of crime and of the criminal must take into account
the economic phase—must consider the subject matter of the study from the economic
standpoint; for while few will follow the socialist theorists in the controlling importance
they assign to the economic factors of social life it is nevertheless manifest that
these factors are powerful elements in the totality of social conditions and must
be given due consideration in the survey of all societal phenomena, including that
of crime. The work selected to represent this viewpoint in the Modern Criminal Science
Series is that of one of the younger criminalists—an able and thorough study of the
effect of economic conditions on crime and distinguished by the extensive and critical
use made of a wide range of statistical data.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">William Adrian Bonger</span>, the author of the work here translated, of Amsterdam, Holland, is a Dutch Publicist,
a pupil of Professor Van Hamel, well known as one of the founders of the International
Union of Penal Law and the most eminent of Dutch students of criminology. He was born
at Amsterdam, September <span class="corr" id="xd31e1492" title="Source: 16">6</span>, 1876, and received the degree of Doctor in Law from the University of Amsterdam
in June, 1905. The first part of the present work, which consists of a survey, with
copious extracts and critical comments, of the previous literature upon the subject
of the relation of crime to economic conditions is a revision of a thesis originally
presented at the University.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bonger is also the author of “Religion and Crime: A Criminological Study”; Leiden,
1913, and numerous articles in Dutch and German periodicals. Among these are the following
in “<span lang="nl">Nieuwe <span class="corr" id="xd31e1499" title="Source: Tÿd">Tijd</span></span>” (The New Age), a well-known Dutch socialist review: “An Apology for War”, a critical
review of “<span lang="de">Die Philosophie des Krieges</span>” <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvi">[<a href="#pb.xvi">xvi</a>]</span>by Professor Steinmetz (1908); “Capital and Income in the Netherlands” (1910); “Marxism

in the Netherlands” (1911); and “Religion and Irreligion in the Netherlands” (1911).
Two noteworthy contributions to “<span lang="de">Neue Zeit</span>” are “Cesare Lombroso” in Vol. XXVIII, number one (1910), and “<span lang="de">Verbrechen und Sozialismus: Zugleich ein Beitrag zum Studium der Kriminalität im Deutschland</span>” in Vol. XXX, number two (1912). In 1912 also appeared “The Social Factors of Crime
and their Significance in Comparison with the Individual Causes” in Vol. XXIII of
the “<span lang="nl"><span class="corr" id="xd31e1515" title="Source: Tÿdschrift">Tijdschrift</span> voor Strafrecht</span>”, the only Dutch journal of criminal law.
</p>
<p>In the first part of this work, instead of stating in his own language the views expressed
in the previous literature on the subject Dr. Bonger has by extracts from the various
authors given us their opinions in their own language, adding brief critical comments
of his own. The second part contains Dr. Bonger’s own discussion of the phenomena
of crime based upon an unusually thorough collection of statistical data and the elaboration
of his views. In the selection of authors from whom he quotes Dr. Bonger shows his
sympathy with the social philosophy of socialism which appears as well in the exposition
of his own explanation of criminality; but the facts which he collects together with
the evidence on which they rest are so explicitly set forth and his own conclusions
so carefully distinguished that the value of the study is not diminished even for
those who are not disposed to accept his social philosophy.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bonger sees clearly that the concept of crime is a social and not a biological
one. It is the social value or harmfulness of acts or conduct that is involved in
the concept and if we use terms that have a predominantly biological connotation such
as “normal” or “abnormal”, we must be careful to distinguish that use as referring
to a social standard or we will be in danger of a confusion of thought. That some
of the acts which society has classed as crimes may be deemed pathological is incidental;
it is not on this account that they are termed crimes but because they are socially
detrimental. That some of the individuals who have committed crimes may be called
“abnormal” is incidental; it is not because of this that they are classified as criminals.
That the economic factor has a large influence in connection with that kind of conduct
the social significance of which stamps it as criminal the author abundantly shows.
The extent to which this is the case and the extent to which the economic conditions
involved are inherent in our present social organization are <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvii">[<a href="#pb.xvii">xvii</a>]</span>matters on which there will be difference of opinion with the author. Dr. Bonger’s
expressed belief that his main positions will be received without sympathy in this
country we venture to think will not prove to be well founded. On the contrary so
clearly has he set them forth and so well has he supported them that they can hardly
fail of appreciation. If this work serves to some extent as a corrective to a too
prevalent tendency toward a confusion of thought between biological and social concepts
and standards in the study of human conduct—and especially that kind of conduct which
we have deemed so socially detrimental as to brand as crime—its inclusion in this
series will be amply justified.

</p>
<p>Dr. Bonger’s work—“Criminality and Economic Conditions”—will arrest the attention
of students of criminology, sociology and kindred subjects. In it, also, the political
economist may delve with profit.
</p>
<p>The eminent scholar and author in his preface to the American edition expresses the
conviction that his “ideas about the etiology of crime will not be shared by a great
many readers of the American edition,” and, also, “that the book is sure to meet with
many disapproving critics on this side of the ocean.” The distinguished author may
be agreeably disappointed in the number of American readers who will agree in a large
measure with his conclusions as to the causes of crime generally. I am inclined to
think that the remedy which Dr. Bonger proposes is more apt to elicit controversy
than the correctness of his diagnosis. The great value of Dr. Bonger’s work to Americans,
however, will be independent of the number of readers who concede the force of his
reasoning or accept the logic of his conclusions. Disagree with the author’s conclusions
as the reader may and its value to the reader will not be impaired. One cannot take
issue with the conclusions of a scholar based on study and research, without an exercise
of processes of the mind valuable to the reader, and probably so to others. From the
right quantity and quality of criticism comes the truth. One of the most valuable
portions of Dr. Bonger’s work will be found in his own criticisms of the writings
of other European authors, particularly those comprising the so-called Italian and
French schools.
</p>
<p>“Criminality and Economic Conditions” is the nearest approach to an exhaustive treatment
of the question of the agencies productive of crime which has thus far been published
in this country. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xx">[<a href="#pb.xx">xx</a>]</span>work is a result of great study and research, and little existing data can have been
overlooked. Agree or not with the conclusions of the author, doubt the force of his
reasoning if one will, nevertheless, such reasoning and conclusions have their basis
in statistics and data furnished, from which other reasoning or conclusions may be
formed if the reader thinks the author’s conclusions are not supported by the facts.
</p>
<p>Whether existing economic conditions are fundamentally wrong, and crime is but the
natural concomitant of a false economic basis upon which society is organized, is
a controversial question which is so forcefully presented by the author that the reader
must concede that his views have been presented by a master.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bonger’s thesis, doubtless, will have the effect of increasing the number of Americans
who regard environment as the greatest contributory cause of crime and who place heredity
or innate criminality in a subordinate position, though many may continue to regard
these matters as of greater importance than the author attributes to them. The author
does not hesitate to express his contempt for the theory recently espoused by some
Americans that “sterilization” may be an effective method of reducing the “army of
criminals.” “One should be inclined to ask,” he says, “if the advocates of ‘sterilization’
have never heard of Australia, where a considerable number of inhabitants have descended
from the worst of criminals and where yet the rate of criminality is low.” The Australian
might reply that this is not a fair test, for at the time England was transporting
so many of her criminals to Australia, the English criminal code was so drastic that
“the worst of criminals” constituted but a small per cent of those who became its
victims. But this observation does not militate against the correctness of the Doctor’s
observation that “sterilization” is “as useful as the efforts to stop with a bottle
a brook in its course.” If the advocates of “sterilization” are wrong in their theory,
it is only illustrative of the fact that we Americans have been so busy developing
a new country that, until very recent years, we gave no thought to the immense problem
of the causes of crime, or attempted to apply to the subject any sort of intelligent,
to say nothing of scientific, consideration. When at last it dawned upon a few of
the American people that the cost in dollars and cents of dealing with our crime problem,
to say nothing of the incidental economic waste, exceeded a billion dollars annually,
or, as Professor Münsterberg in one of his books forcibly puts it: “that this country
spends annually five hundred millions of dollars more on fighting the existing crime
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxi">[<a href="#pb.xxi">xxi</a>]</span>than on all its works of charity, education, and religion”,—it began to be considered
worth while to study this tremendous social problem with a view, if possible, of improving
conditions. Those who investigated the subject found little in the way of statistics
or reliable data upon which to base a study of conditions with a view of applying
remedies. Some few had written upon various phases of the subject. It was not, however,
until the organization of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology in
1909 that intelligent direction along practical lines was given to a study by Americans
of this great social and economic problem. The Journal of the Institute was the first
periodical of its kind published in the English language. In Continental Europe a
number of such journals were being published and many students of the problem had
contributed valuable works upon different phases of the subject. The American Institute
has deemed the quickest way for Americans to become abreast of the best modern thought
on criminal law and criminology, is to make available for American readers the best
scientific thought of European writers, hence, “The Modern Criminal Science Series,”
of which Dr. Bonger’s work becomes one of the most valuable volumes.
</p>
<p>Until very recent years, most American judges and prosecuting attorneys gave little
thought to the underlying causes of crime. It was the general assumption that courts
and court officers had performed their full functions when the guilt or innocence
of a defendant had been determined and he was discharged or committed to some penal
institution. Here again little thought was given to the one incarcerated other than
to hold and generally to exploit him until by law he was entitled to be discharged.
Those whose province it was to get men into prison and those whose duty it was to
keep them in custody gave little attention to the question whether the convict was
a better or a worse unit of society when he came out than when he entered upon a prison
term. Even less thought was given to the more important question—why so many commit
crime at all. If normal human beings under normal conditions do not commit crime,
then crime is evidence of the abnormal, either in the person or in the condition.
If this is a correct hypothesis, then the administration of criminal law must to a
greater degree in the future than in the past be predicated upon a comprehension and
due consideration of this fact.
</p>
<p>If, in order to materially reduce the quantum of crime, it is necessary to change
the economic basis upon which modern society rests and reorganize it “based upon the
community of the means of production”, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxii">[<a href="#pb.xxii">xxii</a>]</span>then the outlook for an early diminution in the volume of crime may not be overly
encouraging. Such a change in the economic basis of society is hardly to be expected
otherwise than as the result of the slow process of social evolution. Progress in
this respect has not been perceptibly rapid since Moses gave to the world the Book
of Deuteronomy. Many abuses of our present economic system, however, may be modified
or abolished without waiting for or conceding the necessity of the change which the
eminent scholar holds is fundamental.
</p>
<p>Again, in conclusion, let me reiterate that the value of Dr. Bonger’s work does not
depend upon an agreement with all the views of the author. The book will bring to
the American reader a depth and breadth of view most valuable to the administrators
of criminal law and to those interested in the wider field of general social progress.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This translation is based upon the Amsterdam edition of 1905, but the translator has
been furnished by the author not only with special notes for the American edition,
but also with the latest corrections to the French text. Dr. Bonger has also furnished
a revised bibliography, and kindly wrote the American preface in English. In the translation
some slight condensation of the work has been made, with the approval of the committee,
by the omission of a few passages of a parenthetical nature, in quotations and notes.
The very valuable bibliographical notes have been retained intact. Grateful acknowledgment
is due to the Editorial Committee for suggestions as to some difficult legal terms,
and to Mr. Georgio de Grassi for assistance in the translation of Italian passages.

<h2 class="main">PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The resolution of the “Committee on Translations of the American Institute of Criminal
Law and Criminology” to include my book “<span lang="fr">Criminalité et conditions économiques</span>” among the European works, that were assigned for translation was welcomed by me
with gladness. The fact that the difference of language is an obstacle for many to
become acquainted with a book, is for its author very disagreeable. This was also
the reason which obliged me to publish my work not in my own but in the French language.
</p>
<p>I am fully convinced that my ideas about the etiology of crime will not be shared
by a great many readers of the American edition. As far as I can see, in the English-speaking
countries the causes of criminality are sought in man himself rather than in his surroundings.
Heredity, too, is considered there of great importance. Hence the attempts to reduce
the army of criminals by so-called “sterilization.” Against this point of view my
book is in sharp opposition; I consider it one of the most fatal errors. There was
a time in Europe when it was thought with Lombroso that crime was rooted in man himself;
the progress of sociology has shown more and more clearly that the roots are found
outside man, in society. There is nothing more variable than man! That heredity plays
a great part on the scene of criminality has never been proved. Have the advocates
of “sterilization”, one should be inclined to ask, never heard of Australia, where
a considerable number of the inhabitants are descended from the worst of criminals,
and where yet the rate of criminality is low? The army of prostitution has been for
a great many centuries by far more “sterile” than the army of criminals can ever be
made, and yet prostitution is not decreased; the increase and decrease of this phenomena
is ruled by social factors. In short, the effect of “sterilization” seems to me as
useful as the efforts to stop with a bottle a brook in its course, as Manouvrier once
called it. On the other hand I beg the adherents of the individualistic theory of
crime <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxviii">[<a href="#pb.xxviii">xxviii</a>]</span>to take into consideration that in some European countries the beginning of the rise
of the lower classes, who form the greatest contingent of criminals, has been sufficient
to arrest the increase of crime, even in many cases to occasion a decrease.
</p>
<p>My book will thus be sure to meet with many disapproving critics on the other side
of the ocean. I fear them not. If only facts are opposed to facts, truth will come
to light. “<span lang="fr">Du choc des opinions jaillit la vérité!</span>”
</p>
<p>According to my undertaking I have stated in notes the principal literature of the
latest years. In concert with the desire of the Committee I have shortened the text
as much as possible. The whole passage about “race and crime” I have omitted because—maintaining
in general what I had written about it—I now have much more to say on the subject,
but the space therefor was not at my disposition. For the same reason I left the passage
on “Physical Environment and Crime” as it was. The treatment in detail of both these
questions will take place in due time elsewhere.
</p>
<p>I will not close this preface without assuring the Committee on Translations how highly
I value their broad view and large-minded resolution to give a hearing to one whose
opinions differ so much from the usual. To my translator, my hearty thanks for the
good care bestowed on my book.

<h2 class="main">THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Honorable mention has been given to the first part of this work, which was written
upon a subject proposed by the juridical faculty of the University of Amsterdam, and
entitled “A Systematic and Critical Exposition of the Literature Dealing with the
Relation between Criminality and Economic Conditions.” To this exposition I have added
the opinions of some additional authors, and have treated some others more fully than
in the original; but on the whole this part of the work has been little changed. The
second part, on the other hand, is almost entirely new; though it is true that in
my thesis I had already marked out a line of investigation which, in my opinion, required
a profound study of the relation between criminality and economic conditions. The
period of one year fixed by the faculty was too limited a time in which to give more
than a brief survey of the question. I have left the exposition as it was without
restating it in the second part (now the more important division of the work), although
I am aware that objections might be made, especially as to the form. However, I have
not felt that these are of sufficient importance to demand a complete recasting of
the work.
</p>
<p>I take advantage of this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to those who have
expressed their good will by lending me their aid; especially to my highly esteemed
colleague, Professor G.&nbsp;A. van Hamel, and my friends Dr. A. Aletrino and N.&nbsp;W. Posthumus.

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In systematizing the literature of my subject I have pursued the following method:
I begin with some significant extracts from authors who wrote before the birth of
modern criminal science. After these I take up the statisticians, that is to say,
those who, without belonging to any special school of criminologists, have treated
the subject principally by the aid of statistics. Next I give an exposition of the
school which insists especially upon the individual factors in crime, and ascribes
only a secondary place to economic factors (the Italian school); following this I
treat of the school which considers the rôle played by environment as very important
(the French school); and afterwards that of the bio-sociological doctrine which forms
the synthesis of the two schools. Then follow the “spiritualists”, that is to say
the religious authors who have been more or less influenced by modern criminal science;
and finally, the authors who belong to the “<span lang="it">terza scuola</span>”, and the socialists who consider the influence of economic conditions as being very
important or even decisive. The authors coming under the same heading have been treated
in chronological order.
</p>
<p>Like every classification this is more or less arbitrary. Several authors might have
been placed under two different headings. We may add that as time goes on the differences
between the Italian and French schools are becoming less and less marked, so that
their opinions and those of the bio-sociologists no longer show any great divergences
as far as our subject is concerned.

<p class="first">In the first part of his “Utopia” More severely criticises the economic conditions
of his time in England, and adds some observations upon the criminality of that period.
</p>
<p>Raphael Hythloday, whom More makes the speaker in his work, and through whom he expresses
his own opinions, says:
</p>
<p>“It chanced on a certain day, when I sat at the Cardinal’s table, there was also a
certain lay man cunning in the laws of your realm. Who, I cannot tell whereof taking
occasion, began diligently and earnestly to praise that strait and rigorous justice,
which at that time was there executed upon felons, who, as he said, were for the most
part twenty hanged together upon one gallows. And, seeing so few escaped punishment,
he said he could not choose but greatly wonder and marvel, how and by what evil luck
it should so come to pass, that thieves nevertheless were in every place so rife and
so rank.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Nay, Sir, quod I (for I durst boldly speak my mind before the Cardinal) marvel nothing
hereat; for this punishment of thieves passeth the limits of justice, and is also
very hurtful to the public weal. For it is too extreme and cruel a punishment for
theft, and yet not sufficient to refrain and withhold men from theft. For simple theft
is not so great an offense, that it ought to be punished with death. Neither is there
any punishment so horrible, that it can keep them from stealing, which have no other
craft whereby to get their living. Therefore in this point, not you only, but also
the most part of the world, be like evil schoolmasters, which be readier to beat,
than to teach their scholars. For great and horrible punishments be appointed for
thieves, whereas much rather provision should have been made, that there were some
means, whereby they might get their living, so that no man should be driven to this
extreme necessity, first to steal, and then to die.
</p>
<p>“Yes (quod he) this matter is well enough provided for already. There be handicrafts,
there is husbandry to get their living by, if they would not willingly be nought.
Nay, quod I, you shall not scape so; for first of all, I will speak nothing of them
that come home out of the wars, maimed and lame, as not long ago, out of Blackheath
field, and a little before that, out of the wars in France; such, I say, as put their
lives in jeopardy for public weal’s or the king’s sake, and by reason of weakness
or lameness be not able to occupy their old crafts, and be too aged to learn new;
of them I will speak nothing, forasmuch as wars have their ordinary recourse. But
let us consider those things that chance daily before our eyes. First there is a great
number of gentlemen, which can not be content to live idle themselves, like drones,
of that which others have labored for; their tenants, I mean, whom they poll and shave
to the quick, by raising their rents (for this only point of frugality do they use,
men else through their lavish and prodigal spending, able to bring themselves to very
beggary) these gentlemen, I say, do not only live in idleness themselves, but also
carry about with them at their tails a great flock or train of idle and loitering
serving men, which never learn any craft whereby to get their livings. These men as
soon as their master is dead, or be sick themselves, be incontinent thrust out of
doors. For gentlemen had rather keep idle persons, than sick men, and many times the
dead man’s heir is not able to maintain so great a house, and keep so many serving
men as his father did. Then in the mean season they that be thus destitute of service,
either starve for hunger, or manfully play the thieves. For what would you have them
do? <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>When they have wandered abroad so long, until they have worn threadbare their apparel,
and also impaired their health, then gentlemen because of their pale and sickly faces,
and patched coats, will not take them into service. And husbandmen dare not set them
a work, knowing well enough that he is nothing meet to do true and faithful service
to a poor man with a spade and a mattock for small wages and hard fare, which being
daintily and tenderly pampered up in idleness and pleasure, was wont with a sword
and buckler by his side to jet through the street with a bragging look, and to think
himself to be as good as any man’s mate.
</p>
<p>“Nay, by Saint Mary, sir (quod the lawyer), not so. For this kind of man must we make
the most of. For in them as men of stouter stomachs, bolder spirits, and manlier courages
than handicrafts men and plowmen be, doth consist the whole power, strength, and puissance
of our army, when we must fight in battle. Forsooth, sir, as well you might say (quod
I) that for war’s sake we must cherish thieves. For surely you shall never lack thieves
while you have them. No, nor thieves be not the most false and faint-hearted soldiers,
nor soldiers be not the cowardliest thieves; so well these two crafts agree together.
But this fault, though it be much used among you, yet is not peculiar to you only,
but common also almost to all nations. Yet France besides this is troubled and infected
with a much sorer plague. The whole realm is filled and besieged with hired soldiers
in peace time (if that be peace) which be brought in under the same color and pretense,
that hath persuaded you to keep these idle serving men. For these wise fools and very
archdolts thought the wealth of the country herein to consist, if there were ever
in readiness a strong and sure garrison, specially of old practised soldiers, for
they put no trust at all in men unexercised. And therefore they must be forced to
seek for war, to the end that they may have practised soldiers and cunning manslayers,
lest that (as it is prettily said by Sallust) their hands and their minds through
idleness and lack of exercise, should wax dull. But how pernicious and pestilent a
thing it is to maintain such beasts, the Frenchmen by their own harms have learned,
and the examples of the Romans, Carthaginians, Syrians, and of many other countries
do manifestly declare. For not only the empire, but also the fields and cities of
all these, by divers occasions have been overrunned and destroyed by their own armies
beforehand had in a readiness. Now how unnecessary a thing this is, hereby it may
appear, that the French soldiers, which from their youth have been practised and inured
in feats of arms, do <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>not crack nor advance themselves to have very often gotten the upper hand and mastery
of your new made and unpractised soldiers. But in this point I will not use many words,
lest perchance I may seem to flatter you.
</p>
<p>“No, nor those same handicraftmen of yours in cities, nor yet the rude and uplandish
plowmen of the country, are not supposed to be greatly afraid of your gentlemen’s
idle serving men, unless it be such as be not of body or stature correspondent to
their strength and courage, or else whose bold stomachs be discouraged through poverty.
Thus you may see, that it is not to be feared lest they should be effeminated, if
they were brought up in good crafts and laborsome works, whereby to get their livings,
whose stout and sturdy bodies (for gentlemen vouchsafe to corrupt and spill none but
picked and chosen men) now either by reason of rest and idleness be brought to weakness
or else by easy and womanly exercises be made feeble and unable to endure hardness.
Truly howsoever the case standeth, this methinketh is nothing available to the public
weal, for war’s sake, which you never have, but when you will yourselves, to keep
and maintain an innumerable flock of that sort of men, that be so troublesome and
noyous in peace, whereof you ought to have a thousand times more regard than of war.
</p>
<p>“But yet this is not the only necessary cause of stealing. There is another, which,
as I suppose, is proper and peculiar to you Englishmen alone. What is that? quod the
Cardinal. Forsooth my Lord (quod I) your sheep that were wont to be so meek and tame,
and so small eaters, now as I hear say, be become so great devourers and so wild,
that they eat up, and swallow down the very men themselves. They consume, destroy,
and devour whole fields, houses, and cities. For look in what parts of the realm doth
grow the finest and therefore dearest wool, there noblemen and gentlemen, yea and
certain abbots, holy men no doubt, not contenting themselves with the yearly revenues
and profits, that were wont to grow to their forefathers and predecessors of their
lands, nor being content that they live in rest and pleasure nothing profiting, yea
much noying the public weal, leave no ground for tillage, they inclose all into pastures;
they throw down houses; they pluck down towns, and leave nothing standing, but only
the church to be made a sheephouse. And as though you lost no land by forests, chases,
lands, and parks, those good holy men turn all dwelling places and all glebeland into
desolation and wilderness. Therefore that one covetous and unsatiable cormorant and
very plague of his native country may compass about <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>and enclose many thousand acres of ground together within one pale or hedge, the husbandmen
be thrust out of their own, or else either by fraud, or by violent oppression they
be put besides it, or by wrongs and injuries they be so wearied, that they be compelled
to sell all. By one means therefore or by other, either by hook or crook they must
needs depart away, poor, silly, wretched souls, men, women, husbands, wives, fatherless
children, widows, woeful mothers, with their young babes, and their whole household
small in substance and much in number, as husbandry requireth many hands. Away they
trudge, I say, out of their known and accustomed houses, finding no place to rest
in. All their household stuff, which is very little worth, though it might well abide
the sale; yet being suddenly thrust out, they be constrained to sell it for a thing
of nought. And when they have wandered abroad till that be spent, what can they do
but steal and then justly pardy be hanged, or else go about begging. Yet then they
also be cast into prison as vagabonds, because they go about and work not, whom no
man will set to work, though they never so willingly profer themselves thereto. For
one shepherd or herdman is enough to eat up that ground with cattle, to the occupying
whereof about husbandry many hands were requisite.
</p>
<p>“And this is also the cause why victuals be now in many places dearer. Yea, besides
this the price of wool is so risen, that poor folks which were wont to work it, and
make cloth thereof, be now able to buy none at all. And by this means very many be
forced to forsake work, and to give themselves to idleness. For after that so much
ground was inclosed for pasture, an infinite multitude of sheep died of the rot, such
vengeance God took of their inordinate and insatiable covetousness, sending among
the sheep that pestiferous murrain, which much more justly should have fallen of the
sheep-masters’ own heads. And though the number of sheep increase never so fast, yet
the price falleth not one mite, because there be so few sellers. For they be almost
all comen into a few rich men’s hands, whom no need forceth to sell before they lust,
and they lust not before they may sell as dear as they lust.
</p>
<p>“Now the same cause bringeth in like dearth of the other kinds of cattle, yea and
that so much the more, because that after the farms plucked down and husbandry decayed,
there is no man that careth about the breeding of young stock. For these rich men
bring not up the young ones of great cattle as they do lambs. But first they buy them
abroad very cheap and afterward, when they be fatted in their pastures, they sell
them again exceeding dear. And <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>therefore (as I suppose) the whole incommodity hereof is not yet felt. For yet they
make dearth only in those places where they sell. But when they fetch them away from
thence where they be bred faster than they can be brought up; then shall there also
be felt great dearth, stock beginning there to fail where the ware is bought. Thus
the unreasonable covetousness of a few hath turned that thing to the utter undoing
of your island, in the which thing the chief felicity of your realm did consist. For
this great dearth of victuals causeth men to keep as little houses and as small hospitality
as they possibly may, and to put away their servants, whither, I pray you, but abegging
or else (which these gentle bloods and stout stomachs will sooner set their minds
unto) astealing?
</p>
<p>“Now to amend the matter, to this wretched beggary and miserable poverty is joined
great wantonness, importunate superfluity and excessive riot. For not only gentlemen’s
servants, but also handicraftman, yea and almost the plowmen of the country, with
all other sorts of people, use much strange and proud newfangledness in their apparel,
and too much prodigal riot and sumptuous fare at their table. Now bawds, queans, whores,
harlots, strumpets, brothel-houses, stews, and yet another stews, winetaverns, alehouses
and tippling houses, with so many naughty, lewd, and unlawful games, as dice, cards,
tables, tennis, bowls, quoits, do not all these send the haunters of them straight
astealing when their money is gone?
</p>
<p>“Cast out these pernicious abominations, make a law that they, which plucked down
farms and towns of husbandry, shall reëdify them, or else yield and uprender the possession
thereof to such as will go to the cost of building them anew. Suffer not these rich
men to buy up all, to engross and forestall, and with their monopoly to keep the market
alone as please them. Let not so many be brought up in idleness, let husbandry and
tillage be restored, let clothworking be renewed, that there may be honest labors
for this idle sort to pass their time profitably, which hitherto either poverty has
caused to be thieves, or else now to be vagabonds, or idle serving men, and shortly
will be thieves. Doubtless unless you find a remedy for these enormities, you shall
in vain advance yourselves of executing justice upon felons. For this justice is more
beautiful in appearance, and more flourishing to the show, than either just or profitable.
For by suffering your youth wantonly and viciously to be brought up, and to be infected,
even from their tender age, by little and little with vice, then in God’s name to
be punished, when they commit the same faults after being come to man’s state, which
from their youth <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>they were ever like to do; in this point, I pray you, what other thing do you, than

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In speaking of the faults which cling to society Meslier, among other things, says
the following about crime:
</p>
<p>“Another abuse, and one that is almost universally accepted and authorized in the
world, is the appropriation of the wealth of the soil by individuals, in place of
which all ought to possess it equally in common and enjoy it equally in common. I
mean all those of the same district or territory, so that they as well as those who
inhabit the same city, town, village, or parish should compose but one great family.
They should all regard themselves as being brothers and sisters one to another and
all children of the same fathers and mothers, who, for this reason ought to love one
another as brothers and sisters and, in consequence, live peaceably together, having
all things common. All should have the same or similar food, should be equally well
lodged, clothed and shod, but should also apply themselves equally to their business,
that is to say, to work or to some other honest and useful employment, each following
his or her profession, or whatever is most necessary and fitting to be done according
to the time or season or the things especially needed. And all this should be done,
not under the direction of those who would like to dominate over others tyrannically
and imperiously, but only under the direction of the wisest and best intentioned,
for the maintenance and advancement of the public weal. All cities and other communities
should also on their own account take great pains to make alliances with their neighbors
and keep inviolable the peace and union between them, in order to aid and succor one
another in time of need; for without this the public well-being cannot be maintained,
and the greater part of mankind must be wretched and unhappy.
</p>
<p>“For first, what results from this individual appropriation of the wealth of the soil
for each to enjoy it severally apart from the others, as it seems good to him? It
results that each is eager to get as much as he can, in all sorts of ways, good and
bad. For cupidity, which is insatiable and, as we know, the root of all evils, looking
through an open door, so to speak, toward the accomplishment of its desires, does
not fail to take advantage of the opportunity, and makes all <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>men do whatever they can in order to have an abundance of goods and riches, and to
be so protected from indigence as to have the pleasure and contentment of enjoying
whatever they wish. From this it happens that those who are the strongest, the most
crafty, the most skilful, and often even the most wicked and unworthy, have the largest
share in the wealth of the soil and are best provided with all the good things of
life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1722src" href="#xd31e1722">4</a>
</p>
<p>“This is not all, but it also results from this abuse of which I have been speaking,
namely that wealth is so badly distributed among men, some having everything, or at
least much more than their true share, and others having nothing, or lacking a part
of what is useful and necessary … it results from this, I say, that hatred and envy
first of all arise. From these spring in turn murmurings, complainings, commotions,
insurrections, and wars, which cause an infinity of evils among men. From these again
proceed thousands and millions of mischievous lawsuits which the private owners are
obliged to have among themselves to defend their property and to maintain what they
consider their rights. These suits cause thousands of pains to the body, and tens
of thousands of disquietudes to the mind, and often enough cause the entire ruin of
both parties. From this it also happens that those who have nothing, or who have not
all that they need, are constrained and obliged to employ evil means to get subsistence.
From this come the frauds, deceptions, rascalities, injustices, extortions, robberies,
thefts, murders, assassinations, and brigandages which cause such an infinity of evils
among men.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1727src" href="#xd31e1727">5</a>

Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men”, is worth quoting.

‘This is mine’, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder
of civil society. What crimes, wars, and murders, what miseries and horrors would

<p class="first">In his “<span lang="fr">Code de la nature</span>” this author seeks to show that the harmony in which men lived in primitive society
(when common property existed) has been destroyed by the institution of private property,
which, coming in little by little, has changed common interests into contrary interests.
He expresses himself on this point as follows:
</p>
<p>“Every division of goods, whether equal or unequal, and all individual appropriation
of the portions so formed are what Horace calls ‘<span lang="la">Summi materiam mali</span>.’ All political or moral phenomena are the effects of this pernicious cause. It is
by this that we can explain all theorems and problems with regard to the origin, development,
connection, and affinity of virtues or vices, disorders, and crimes; also with regard
to the true motives of good or bad actions, the determinations and perplexities of
the human will, the depravity of the passions, the inefficacy of precepts and laws
to restrain them; and, finally, with regard to the monstrous creations resulting from
the aberrations of the mind and the heart. The reason, I say, for all these things
can be ascribed to the general obstinacy of legislators about breaking or letting
any one else break the cord with which sociability was first bound by those who usurped
to their own use soil that ought to belong indivisibly to all humanity.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1762src" href="#xd31e1762">7</a>
</p>
<p>Farther along he defines the same idea more exactly when he says: “Take away property,
I repeat without ceasing, and you destroy forever a thousand factors which lead men
to desperate extremities. I say that, delivered from this tyrant, it is totally impossible
that man should give himself to crimes, that he should be a thief, an assassin, or
a conqueror. The laws which authorize property punish him, it is true, for these crimes.
Even his own remorse and fears, sprung from the prejudices of the moral system in
which he has been raised, punish him still more. But the most severe chastisement
of the offender is the primitive and innate feeling of benevolence. This inner voice
of Nature, though commonly confined to the indifferent admonition not to injure, has
still force enough to make the criminal feel keenly.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1767src" href="#xd31e1767">8</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following passage taken from the introduction to Beccaria’s “<span lang="fr">Des délits et des peines</span>” is not without importance for our subject:
</p>
<p>“The advantages of society ought to be equally divided among all its members. However,
when men are gathered together we note a constant tendency to collect privileges,
power, and happiness in the hands of a small minority, and to leave for the multitude
only poverty and weakness. It is only by good laws that this tendency can be checked.
But ordinarily men leave the regulation of the most important matters to temporary
laws and to the caution of the moment, or even entrust them to the discretion of those
whose interests are opposed to the best institutions and the wisest laws.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1787src" href="#xd31e1787">9</a>
</p>
<p>“If we turn to history we shall see that laws, which ought to be agreements freely
made between free men, have oftenest been only the instrument of the passions of the
minority or the result of the chance of the moment, never the work of a wise observer
of human nature who has known how to direct all the actions of the multitude to this
single end: <i>The greatest good of the greatest number</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1794src" href="#xd31e1794">10</a>
</p>
<p>In Section 35 (“On Theft”) we read, among other things, as follows:
</p>
<p>“A theft committed without violence ought to be punished merely by a fine. It is just
that he who takes the property of another should be deprived of his own. But if theft
is ordinarily the crime of poverty and despair, if this offense is committed only
by that class of unfortunate men to whom the right of property (a terrible right and
perhaps not a necessary one) has left no possession but mere existence, the imposition
of a fine will contribute only to multiply thefts, by increasing the number of the
indigent, and robbing an innocent family of bread to give it to a rich man who is
perhaps himself a criminal.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1800src" href="#xd31e1800">11</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his “<span lang="fr"><span class="corr" id="xd31e1812" title="Source: Theorie">Théorie</span> des lois civiles</span>”, directed principally against Montesquieu’s “<span lang="fr">L’esprit des lois</span>”, in which Linguet seeks to defend the thesis, “The spirit of the laws is Property”,
there are some interesting <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>passages. After having shown that private property has been founded upon violence,
he treats of the origin of the laws and, at the same time, of the causes of crime,
and says:
</p>
<p>“Among men all equal, all robust, passionate, sanguinary, and accustomed to arms,
dangerous disputes would continually arise. It would be impossible but that chance
and intelligence should produce great inequality of fortune. He who believed that
he had been injured would wish to get justice for himself. The association formed
to secure the booty would be troubled by the difficulty of enjoying it. These inconveniences
occurred to the clearest thinkers and they sought to find a remedy. It was a totally
new art that they created. But as it is almost always science that misleads, and as
truth is never so easy to discover as at a distance from the Doctors, they looked
about to see what route they should take.
</p>
<p>“They thought that a primary act of violence was incontestably necessary. They could
not disavow it, since it was the sole basis of their rights. But they also saw that
it was necessary to prevent any further violence, since this would fall upon themselves.
They conceived that the primitive usurpation ought to be regarded as a sacred title;
but they perceived no less clearly that it was necessary to proscribe any new usurpation,
which would contradict the ancient one and destroy it. In order to succeed in this
they proposed to authorize only those brigandages which were carried on in common,
and to punish severely those persons who dared to commit individual acts of spoliation.
In response to their suggestions it was decreed that society should have the right
to take everything, but that the members of society, as individuals, should be deprived
of this right. They agreed that each should have peaceful possession of the part allotted
to him, and that whoever tried to take it from him should be declared a public enemy
and prosecuted as such.
</p>
<p>“Here, then, in a few words is the source of all human laws. From it spring laws of
every kind except the divine law, the source of which is as pure as its author. Upon
this basis are founded all imaginable constitutions. This it is which sanctions the
law of nations and the civil law, of which the one legitimates conquests, and the
other proscribes robbery, only punishing, however, the thefts not committed by a large
company. Finally this same principle has directed the steps of all politicians and
of all founders of governments and empires.
</p>
<p>“They have come by different ways, the details of which it is useless to discuss here,
to change the original social anarchy, in which these principles were discovered,
into administrations more or less <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>imperfect. Violence thus formed the foundation of their rights, but all wished to
keep with justice what they got possession of very unjustly. They took precautions
to prevent those who assisted them in their wholesale conquest from imitating them
in detail. After making sure of the general domain they did not wish any one to be
able to dispute the particular distribution of it. They confirmed by regulations all
their accomplices in the possession of what they had had the address or the good fortune
to seize. They decreed that any one who, seeing these possessions stolen by force,
should attempt to secure restitution by the same method, should be punished as guilty
of an offense against society.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1828src" href="#xd31e1828">12</a>
</p>
<p>In the chapter “Good and Evils which Laws Produce” Linguet pronounces the following
trenchant and satirical judgment:
</p>
<p>“The aim [of justice and law], as we have said, is to give society a fixed position.
There results from them an invariable order which keeps each member in his place.
It is by their means that the multitude who do not know them, even while they respect
them, submit without repugnance to the small number who are armed by them. In this
sense there is nothing so admirable as the law. It is the most sublime invention that
ever presented itself to the human mind. It offers to any reflective individual the
most satisfying, the most beautiful of spectacles. To restrain force and violence
by pacific means; to subjugate the liveliest passions; to assure to painful virtues
the preference over easy and delusive vices; to direct the eyes, the hands, and the
hearts of men; to subdue them without preventing them from believing themselves free;
to prescribe duties capable of securing the repose of docile souls who performed them,
and of protecting them against rebellious spirits, who wish to be exempt from them;
all this the laws do or ought to do. It would be difficult to join together so much
greatness with so many benefits.
</p>
<p>“But as the theory of the laws is honorable to the humanity which has been able to
grasp it, so the practical application of the laws has been most distressing, when,
after the observance of them has been recommended, it is necessary to pass on to the
punishments decreed for the offenses which violate them. The passions which self-interest
unceasingly incites often necessitate this grievous extremity. Then we see men authorized
by general consent to exercise an inflexible rigor upon their fellows. We hear justice
pronounce sentences which would pass for cruel if they were not indispensable. It
makes use of prisons, executioners, gallows. Liberty and even life become pledges
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>of which justice deprives men at pleasure when they abuse them. To make good the losses
which the state suffers from the crimes that disturb it, it comes back upon the criminals,
and consequently suffers almost equally from the crime and from the punishment.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1837src" href="#xd31e1837">13</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the third section of his “<span lang="fr">Système social</span>”, under the heading, “The Influence of Government upon Morals”, Holbach, in treating
of the causes of crime says among other things:
</p>
<p>“In China they punish the mandarin in the department in which a great crime has been
committed. A bad government has its own negligence or its own injustice to blame for
the great number of malefactors who are found in a state. The multiplicity of criminals
proclaims an administration as tyrannical and careless. The severity of taxes, the
vexations and hardships inflicted by the rich and great multiply the number of the
unfortunate, whom poverty often reduces to despair and who avail themselves of crime
as the promptest means of escape from their condition. If wealth is the mother of
vices, poverty is the mother of crimes. When a state is badly governed and wealth
is too unequally divided, so that millions of men lack the necessaries of life, while
a small number of citizens are surfeited with luxuries, there we commonly see a great
number of criminals, whose number punishments do not diminish. If a government punishes
the unfortunate it leaves undisturbed the vices that are leading the state to its
ruin; it erects gibbets for the poor, whereas by bringing men to poverty it has itself
made thieves, assassins, and criminals of every kind; it punishes crime, while it
continually invites men to commit crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1853src" href="#xd31e1853">14</a>
</p>
<p>“The man who has no share in the wealth of the state is not held to society by any
bond. How can we expect a crowd of unfortunates to whom we have given neither principles
nor morals to remain quiet spectators of the abundance, the luxury, the unjustly acquired
riches of so many corrupt individuals, who seem to insult the general poverty, and
are only rarely disposed to relieve it? By what right can society punish the thieving
servant who has been a witness of the unpunished robberies and extortions of his master,
or has seen public thieves strutting along, enjoying the consideration of their <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>fellow citizens, and shamelessly displaying the fruits of their extortions under the
very eyes of the heads of the state? How can we make the poor respect the property
of others when they themselves have been the victims of the rapacity of the rich,
or have seen the property of their fellow citizens snatched away by violence or fraud
with impunity? Finally how can we successfully preach submission to men to whom everything
proves that the laws, armed against themselves alone, are indulgent toward the great
and happy, and are inexorable only for the unhappy and poor? ‘A man dies but once’
and the imagination of the criminal familiarizes itself little by little with the
idea of the most cruel punishments. He ends by regarding them as a ‘<span lang="fr">mauvais quart d’heure</span>’, and would as soon perish by the hand of the executioner as die of hunger, or even
work all his life without reward.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1863src" href="#xd31e1863">15</a>

from his “<span lang="fr">De la <span class="corr" id="xd31e1876" title="Source: legislation">législation</span> ou principes des lois</span>”:
</p>
<p>“The more I reflect upon it the more I am convinced that inequality of fortune and
condition disorders man and alters the natural sentiments of his heart, for the habit
of luxury gives him a desire for things that are useless for his true happiness and
fills his mind with the most unjust and absurd prejudices and errors. I believe that
equality, while satisfying modest requirements, keeps those requirements modest, and
preserves in the soul a peace which is opposed to the birth and progress of the passions.
By what strange folly should we have cultivated a studied elegance and refinement
in our needs if inequality of fortune had not accustomed us to regard this ridiculous
fastidiousness as a proof of superiority, and attained thereby a certain consideration?
Why should I consider as below me a man who is perhaps my superior in merit; why should
I pretend to have authority over him and so open the door to tyranny, to servitude,
and all the vices most fatal to society, if the inequality of conditions had not exposed
my soul to ambition, as the inequality of fortune has exposed it to avarice? It is
inequality alone that has taught men to prefer many useless and harmful things to

would be easier than to prevent abuses and maintain the law. <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>Equality is certain to produce all good, because it unites men, elevates their souls,
and prepares them for mutual feelings of benevolence and amity. Inequality, on the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his “<span lang="fr">Théorie des loix criminelles</span>” we find among others the following passages that are of interest in connection with
the subject which occupies our attention:
</p>
<p>“A man is not born an enemy to society. It is circumstances which give him that title,
such as poverty or misfortune. He does not disturb the general tranquillity until
he has lost his own. He ceases to be a good citizen only when the name becomes meaningless
in his case; and it is when poverty has destroyed his own privileges that he dares
to attack those of his fellows. To make all citizens happy is, then, to prevent the
inception of crime; and the rarity of crime is in direct ratio to the goodness of
the administration. This simple principle, however unknown to administrators even
to the present day, is no less solid on that account, no less luminous, and ought
no less to serve as the basis for government. If it has been neglected, it is because
it has appeared easier to rulers to punish the unfortunate being who demands the rights
that nature gave him, than to satisfy his just demand; to stifle the cries of anguish,
than to change them to shouts of applause. The penal code of every nation is much
like the bull of Phalaris; its imposing garb of juridical forms, like the timbrels
and other instruments surrounding the brazen monster, prevent the cries of the victims
from reaching the ear. Tyrants cry out to the credulous spectators that blood is necessary
to the public safety; good legislators are greedy of it.
</p>
<p>“The first and most efficacious means of preventing crimes consists, then, in a wise
administration that procures the general happiness. When the rays of the beneficent
star that rules extend their influence even to the lowest ranks of society, they are
rarely sullied by punishments; each, concentrating itself upon the spot where heaven
has thrown it, makes the day that it lightens joyous and blessed (and crime is so
near to the man who is forced to curse his fate!)<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> If the taxes are light and not severely felt, if subsistence is <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>easy, the number of marriages increases, they are happy, and the population multiplies.
The people then do not regret their labors, since they are interspersed with pleasures.
They are attached to the fatherland, which offers them good fortune, and to life,
which gives them the means of enjoying it. A man does not disturb the public peace,
because his own prosperity is the fruit of it. A property-holder himself, he takes
good care not to do any violence to the right of property, and even where he would
not naturally have a horror of bloodshed, his days are too precious to him for him
to dare to cut short those of his fellow-citizens.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1907src" href="#xd31e1907">17</a>
</p>
<p>“… What sovereign, I say, cannot easily see that he has in his hand the true means
of restraining crime, namely to secure the public well-being by means of civil legislation.
Yes, the more perfect civil legislation becomes the less need there will be for criminal
legislation. And this need will disappear entirely when the twofold basis upon which
civil legislation ought to rest becomes fixed and invariable; when the property and
the liberty of subjects are respected by the monarch; when the unfortunate man who
has been born without property (though with the same needs as others) can, by working,
correct the injustice of fate, and destroy the inequality of the distribution of wealth;
when, finally, the fruit of his labor will not be the prey of the greedy tax-gatherer.
The rich man can then enjoy his wealth in safety, because despair will no longer expose
him to the knife of the poor man whom his proud opulence insults. We posit here as
the foundation of good legislation the security of real and personal property, but
a masterpiece of statesmanship would be, to make them useless, if it were possible,
by abolishing them altogether. This would be to tear up crime by the roots. It was
thus that Lycurgus, whose laws have been so calumniated because to narrow minds they
seemed impossible of imitation, cleverly dried up the source of all crime. To avoid
attacks upon property he abolished it; to prevent adultery he had all women held in
common; to make the Spartan a hero he made him the slave of his harsh legislation;
finally to prevent the sad effects of the passions he permitted none but the passion
for the public weal. This is why crimes were so rare in Sparta as long as these laws
were faithfully observed. But when Lysander brought back from the fatal conquest of
Athens treasures, the taste for art and the rage for luxury, all the vices were rapidly
introduced. Then crimes broke out; ambition made men commit perjuries, assassinations,
treasons; then the virtuous Agis, who wanted to revive <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>morality, perished under the perfidious knife of the royal servitude; then men like
Nabis and Machanidas appeared; and finally a penal code was introduced, and Sparta
was reduced to the status of an ordinary city.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1914src" href="#xd31e1914">18</a>
</p>
<p>“Ought we to be astonished that the attacks upon the social laws are so multiplied
to-day, and that there are always so many thieves and assassins, when to the causes
of crime which we have developed it is necessary to add that horrible malady of European
states, mendicity? When the water destined by nature to quench the thirst of all men
is artificially diverted into particular channels for the exclusive use of certain
individuals, the unfortunate man, tormented by need, falls into despair, and in a
rage breaks these fatal channels, making the fragments fall upon the heads of his
enemies. Exclusive possession of property has everywhere produced poverty in the most
numerous class, and poverty has given birth to mendicity, which, robbing with one
hand to satisfy hunger, with the other plunges a dagger into the bosom of the rich
to stop their cries. Here we have in two words the origin of theft and murder. To
destroy the roots of these it would be necessary to restore among men the equality
of condition so praised by modern philosophers, but not at all included in the programs
of modern governments. It would be necessary to distribute wealth equally among all
citizens, to eradicate from their hearts the corrosive desire of ambition, and to
blunt the spur of their personal interest.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1919src" href="#xd31e1919">19</a>
</p>
<p>In his “<span lang="fr">Recherches philosophiques sur la propriété et sur le vol</span>” Brissot gives an exposition of natural property, and of property as established
by society. He says of crime: “Civil property is very different from natural property,
as we have shown. It is not based upon the same title, and has not the same aim or
the same bounds. Need is the limit of natural property. Civil property goes further
and includes superfluities. In nature each man has a right to everything; in society
the man to whom his parents have left no property has a right to nothing. In nature
he would be guilty if he did not satisfy his needs; he is guilty in society when he
satisfies them if he has no property. Society has, then, upset all the ideas of property
given by nature. It has destroyed the equilibrium between human beings which nature
established. Equality banished there appear the odious distinctions of rich and poor.
Society has been divided into two classes, the first consisting of citizens with property,
living in idleness; the second and more numerous class composed of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>mass of the people, to whom the right to exist has been sold dear, and who are degraded
and condemned to perpetual toil. To confirm this new right of property the most cruel
punishments have been pronounced upon all those who disturb or attack it. The breach
of this right is called theft; and see how far we are from nature! The thief in the
state of nature is the rich man, the man who has a superfluity; in society the thief
is he who robs this rich man. What a complete transposition of ideas!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1929src" href="#xd31e1929">20</a>
</p>
<p>“If man retains, even in society, the inalienable right of property which nature has
given him, nothing can take it from him, nothing can prevent his exercising it. If
the other members of society concentrate in their own persons the possession of all
the soil; if those who are robbed by this spoliation and forced to have recourse to
labor cannot by this means secure their whole subsistence, then they have the right
to exact from the others, who hold property, the means of satisfying their needs.
They have a claim upon the wealth of others in proportion to their own necessity,
and force used to resist this claim is violence. The rich man is the only thief; he
alone ought to hang from those infamous gallows which are raised only to punish the
man born in poverty for being needy; only to force him to stifle the voice of nature,
the cry of liberty; only to compel him to subject himself to a harsh servitude in
order to avoid an ignominious death.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1934src" href="#xd31e1934">21</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">W. Godwin.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the third chapter of the First Book of his “Enquiry Concerning Political Justice”,
Godwin treats of two important kinds of crime, theft and fraud.
</p>
<p>Of these he says: “Two of the greatest abuses relative to the interior policy of nations
which at this time prevail in the world, consist in the irregular transfer of property,
either first by violence, or secondly by fraud. If among the inhabitants of a country
there existed no desire in one individual to possess himself of the substance of another,
or no desire so vehement and restless as to prompt him to acquire it by means inconsistent
with order and justice, undoubtedly in that country guilt could scarcely be known
but by report. If every man could with perfect facility obtain the necessities of
life, and, obtaining them, feel no uneasy craving after its superfluities, <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>temptation would lose its power. Private interest would visibly accord with public
good; and civil society become what poetry has feigned of the golden age. Let us inquire
into the principles to which these evils are indebted for their existence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1948src" href="#xd31e1948">22</a>
</p>
<p>According to him these crimes are the consequence:
</p>
<p>First, Of poverty, which has reached enormous dimensions (in England one person out
of every seven has at some time received public aid). The situation has become such
that for the poor man the state of society is a state of war. He considers society
not as a body whose object is to maintain personal rights and to procure to each individual
the means of providing for his own support, but as a body that protects the advantageous
position of one class of persons, while holding others in a state of poverty and dependence.
</p>
<p>Second, Of the ostentation of the rich, who make the poor man feel all the more what
he is deprived of.
</p>
<p>Third, Of the tyranny of the rich, made permanent by legislation, by the administration
of the laws, and by the distribution of wealth.
</p>
<p>In his Eighth Book (“Of Property”), Godwin elaborates the ideas given above. Speaking
of the moral improvement that would result from the abolition of private property,
he says: “And here it is obvious that the great occasions for crime would be cut off
forever. All men love justice. All men are conscious that man is a being of one common
nature, and feel the propriety of the treatment they receive from one another being
measured by one common standard. Every man is desirous of assisting another; whether
we should choose to ascribe this to an instinct implanted in his nature which renders
this a source of personal gratification, or to his perception of the reasonableness
of such assistance. So necessary a part is this of the constitution of mind, that
it may be doubted whether any man perpetrates any action, however criminal, without
having first invented some sophistry, some palliation, by which he proves to himself
that it is best to be done. Hence it appears, that offense, the invasion by one man
upon the security of another, is a thought alien to the human mind, and which nothing
could have reconciled us to but the sharp sting of necessity. To consider merely the
present order of society, it is evident that the first offense must have been his
who began a monopoly, and took advantage of the weakness of his neighbors to secure
certain exclusive privileges to himself. The man on the other hand who determined
to put an end to this monopoly, and who peremptorily demanded what was superfluous
to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>possessor and would be of extreme benefit to himself, appeared to his own mind to
be merely avenging the offended laws of justice. Were it not for the plausibleness
of this apology, it is to be presumed that there would be no such thing as crime in
the world.
</p>
<p>“The fruitful source of crimes consists in this circumstance, one man’s possessing
in abundance that of which another man is destitute. We must change the nature of
mind before we can prevent it from being powerfully influenced by this circumstance,
when brought strongly home to its perceptions by the nature of its situation. Man
must cease to have senses, the pleasures of appetite and vanity must cease to gratify,
before he can look on tamely at the monopoly of these pleasures. He must cease to
have a sense of justice before he can clearly and fully approve this mixed scene of
superfluity and want. It is true that the proper method of curing this inequality
is by reason and not by violence. But the immediate tendency of the established administration
is to persuade that reason is impotent. The injustice of which they complain is upheld
by force, and they are too easily induced, by force to attempt its correction. All
they endeavor is the partial correction of an injustice, which education tells them
is necessary, but more powerful reason affirms to be tyrannical.
</p>
<p>“Force grew out of monopoly. It might accidentally have occurred among savages whose
appetites exceeded their supply, or whose passions were inflamed by the presence of
the object of their desire; but it would gradually have died away, as reason and civilization
advanced. Accumulated property has fixed its empire; and henceforth all is an open
contention of the strength and cunning of the one party against the strength and cunning
of the other. In this case the violent and premature struggles of the necessitous
are undoubtedly an evil. They tend to defeat the very cause in the success of which
they are most deeply interested; they tend to procrastinate the triumph of truth.
But the true crime in every instance is in the selfish and partial propensities of
men, thinking only of themselves, and despising the emolument of others; and of these
the rich have their share.
</p>
<p>“The spirit of oppression, the spirit of servility, and the spirit of fraud, these
are the ultimate growth of the established administration of property. They are alike
hostile to intellectual and moral improvement. The other vices of envy, malice, and
revenge are their inseparable companions. In a state of society where men lived in
the midst of plenty, and where all shared alike the bounties of <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The narrow principle of selfishness
would vanish. No man would be obliged to guard his little store, or provide with anxiety
and pain for his restless wants, each would lose his individual existence in the thought
of the general good. No man would be an enemy to his neighbor, for they would have
no subject of contention; and of consequence philanthropy would resume the empire
which reason assigns her; mind would be delivered from her perpetual anxiety about
corporal support, and free to expatiate in the field of thought which is congenial
to her. Each would assist the inquiries of all.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1966src" href="#xd31e1966">23</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">R. Owen.</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1975src" href="#xd31e1975">24</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The author in several works has given us his ideas upon the relation between crime
and the social environment, and especially economic conditions. It is in “The Book
of the New Moral World”, which appeared in 1844, that his views are best expressed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2001src" href="#xd31e2001">25</a>
</p>
<p>They may be summed up as follows: It is not the man himself, it is his circumstances
that form his character; an unfavorable environment produces a bad man, a favorable
one a good man. The organization of the society of today is such that it awakens in
a man all evil qualities. The greater part of mankind live in conditions of the greatest
poverty, and become physically, intellectually, and morally inferior. The working
classes are housed in unsanitary dwellings, work too hard and too long, and are insufficiently
clothed and nourished.
</p>
<p>Improper production and distribution of wealth are the causes of the prevalence of
disorder and anarchy. The means of production, the raw materials and the productive
forces, are sufficient to provide <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>amply for the needs of all. But competition by devouring wealth prevents this, and
brings it about that while some have a superfluity, the majority have not even the
necessaries of life (a fact which is one great cause of criminality). The process
of distribution adds enormously to the waste because of the great number of intermediaries.
</p>
<p>Education and instruction are neglected to the last degree. The children of the lower
classes are almost entirely deprived of instruction, not to say education; their parents,
never having been taught themselves, are incapable of imparting instruction, nor have
they the leisure for it. However, the children of all classes are made egotistical
and anti-social; they have impressed upon them the maxim “Each one for himself”, in
place of being taught that the love of one’s neighbor is the principle upon which
society ought to be based.
</p>
<p>Owen finds the cause of crime, then, in the organization of society upon the basis
of private property. The following is a characteristic passage from Volume VI, “General
Constitution of Government and Universal Code of Law”:
</p>
<p>“Private property has been, and is at this day, the cause of endless crime and misery
to man, and he should hail the period when the progress of science, and the knowledge
of the means to form a superior character for all the individuals of the human race,
render its continuance not only unnecessary, but most injurious to all; injurious
to an incalculable extent to the lower, middle, and upper classes. The possession
of private property tends to make the possessor ignorantly selfish; and selfish, very
generally, in proportion to the extent of the property held by its claimant.…
</p>
<p>“Private property also deteriorates the character of its possessor in various ways;
it is calculated to produce in him pride, vanity, injustice, and oppression, with
a total disregard of the natural and inalienable rights of his fellow men. It limits
his ideas within the little narrow circle of self, prevents the mind from expanding
to receive the extended views beneficial for the human race, and understand great
general interests that could be made most essentially to improve the character and
condition of all.…
</p>
<p>“Private property alienates mind from mind, is a perpetual cause of repulsive action
throughout society, a never-failing source of deception and fraud between man and
man, and a strong stimulus to prostitution among women. It has caused war throughout
all the past ages of the world’s known history, and has been a stimulant to innumerable
private murders.
</p>
<p>“It is now the sole cause of poverty and its endless crimes and <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>miseries over the world, and in principle it is as unjust as it is unwise in practice.
</p>
<p>“In a rational-made society it will never exist. Whatever may have been its necessity
or utility, before the introduction of the supremacy of machinery and chemistry, it
is now most unnecessary and an unmixed evil; for every one, from the highest to the
lowest, may be ensured through life much more of all that is really beneficial for
humanity, and the permanent happiness of the individual, through public scientific
arrangements, than it is possible to obtain through the scramble and contest for procuring
and maintaining private property.
</p>
<p>“Private property also continually interferes with or obstructs public measures which
would greatly benefit all, and frequently to merely please the whim or caprice of
an ill-trained individual.…
</p>
<p>“With a well arranged scientific system of public property, equal education and condition,
there will be no mercenary or unequal marriages; no spoiled children; and none of
the evils which proceed from these errors in the present system, if crudities which
pervade all the departments of life, and are thoroughly inconsistent, can be called
a system of society.
</p>
<p>“In fact, as soon as individuals shall be educated and placed—and it is for the best
and permanent interest of society that all should be educated and placed—the saving
of time, labour, and capital, between public and private property, will be beyond
any estimate the mind of man can form in favour of public property.…
</p>
<p>“Therefore the twelfth law<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2025src" href="#xd31e2025">26</a> will be, that—
</p>
<p>“ ‘Under the Rational System of society—after the children shall have been trained
to acquire new habits and new feelings, derived from a knowledge of the laws of human
nature—there shall be no useless private property.’
</p>
<p>“The old system of the world has been created and governed on the assumed principle
of man’s responsibility to <i>man</i>, and by <i>man’s</i> rewards and punishments.
</p>
<p>“And this principle has been assumed upon the original supposition, that man was born
with power to form himself into any character he liked; to believe or disbelieve whatever
he pleased; and that he could love, hate, or be indifferent as to all persons and
things, according to an independent will which enabled him to do as he liked in all
these respects.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The present system is, therefore, essentially a system supported and governed by
laws of punishment and reward of man’s creating, in opposition to nature’s laws of
punishing and rewarding. The former system is artificial, and always produces crime
and misery, continually increasing, and therefore requiring new laws to correct the
evils necessarily forced upon society by the old laws; thus laws are multiplied without
limit by man to counteract nature’s laws, and ever without success. While nature’s
beautiful and benevolent laws, if consistently acted upon in a system made throughout
in accordance with them, would produce knowledge, goodness, and happiness, continually
increasing, to the human race.
</p>
<p>“By man’s laws being forced upon the population of all countries, in continual opposition
to nature’s laws; with law added to law, in the vain attempt to remedy endless previous
laws, the world had been made and kept criminal, with crimes multiplying as human
laws increased.
</p>
<p>“The laws of man are made to support injustice, and give additional power to the oppressor
and to the man devoid of truth and honesty over the innocent and just. And such must
be the result, as long as human laws, lawyers, and law paraphernalia shall be sanctioned
by society.…
</p>
<p>“Nature’s laws carry with them the only just rewards and punishments that man should
experience; and they are, in every case, efficient for nature’s purposes, and to ensure
the happiness of man in all countries and climes; and, differing from man’s puny,
short-sighted laws, they are always adequate to the end intended to be accomplished.
And this end is evidently to increase human knowledge and happiness. It is through
these laws of nature, that man has attained the knowledge which he has acquired. He
has been continually urged onward to make discoveries, and to invent, through pain
experienced, or pleasure enjoyed or anticipated.
</p>
<p>“But man has been trained to have his character formed, and to be governed by laws
of his own making; his habits, manners, ideas, and associations of ideas have emanated,
directly or indirectly, from his artificial and injurious source; and, in consequence,
the mind, language, and practice of all individuals have become a chaos of confusion.
And this chaos in the character and conduct of individuals has made a yet greater
chaos in all the proceedings of society: and, in consequence, man is now opposing
man, and nation opposing nation, all over the earth. Yet all nature declares, that
it shall be by union of man with man, and nation with nation, that the human <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>race can ever attain a high degree of permanent prosperity and happiness, or become
rational.
</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, while this irrational individual and general character shall remain,
those men and women who have been made to receive this character, and to be so injured,
must continue for a time to be governed by these most injurious laws. The laws of
nature being alone applicable to a society, whose laws are in accordance with the
laws of nature.
</p>
<p>“When this rational society shall be formed, and men, individually and generally,
shall be trained to act in accordance with it, then shall human punishments and rewards
cease, and cease for ever.
</p>
<p>“The thirteenth law will therefore be, that—
</p>
<p>“ ‘As soon as the members of these scientific associations shall have been educated,
from infancy, in a knowledge of the laws of their nature, trained to act in obedience
to them, and surrounded by circumstances all in unison with them, there shall be no
individual reward or punishment.’
</p>
<p>“The Rational System of society is one and indivisible in its principles and practices;
each part is essential to its formation. It is one unvarying consistent system for
forming the character of all individuals, and for governing their affairs; and it
is essentially a system to prevent evil, and render individual punishment and reward
as unnecessary, as they are unjust and injurious to all.…
</p>
<p>“Individual punishments and rewards, ignorance, the inferior feelings and passions,
with all crimes and miseries, will go together when the irrational system shall be
abolished. <i>When the cause of evil shall be removed, then will the evil cease, and not before.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2056src" href="#xd31e2056">27</a>

<p class="first">In the second part of his “<span lang="fr">Voyage en Icarie</span>” the author treats of the relation between crime and economic conditions. In his
opinion <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>money and inequality of fortune and of property are the causes of all crimes. The
following quotation explains his views. (The work speaks of present day society as
in the past, and supposes the existence of a state with common property.)
</p>
<p>“Wealth and superfluity being, by their nature, as I have already said, injustice
and usurpation, the poor often thought only of robbing the rich; and theft, under
all its forms (swindling, pocket-picking, bankruptcy, breach of trust, fraud, cheating,
etc.), was the almost universal occupation of the poor as well as of the rich. And
the poor robbed not only the rich, they robbed even the poor themselves, so that all,
rich and poor, were both robbers and robbed.
</p>
<p>“It would be impossible to enumerate all the kinds of theft and classes of thieves.
It was in vain that the rich had terrible laws made against theft; it was in vain
that the prisons and galleys were kept filled with poor thieves, and that their blood
was often poured out upon the scaffold. Buoyed up by the hope of not being discovered,
the poor robbed in the fields, or in houses, or upon the highroads, or even in the
streets at night. The skilful pick-pocket stole even in open day. The audacious swindler
robbed by means of trickery and deceit, sometimes by selling things of no value, sometimes
by taking advantage of credulity or even of beneficence.
</p>
<p>“Shall I speak of the counterfeiters of every description? Shall I also speak of the
usurers, the great thieves, the wolves of the bourse and the bank, the contractors
and monopolists? Shall I speak of those who enriched themselves by means of public
calamities, who desired or provoked invasions or wars in order to make their fortunes,
and famines in order to amass money in the midst of corpses? Shall I speak of the
thieves who risked the public health by adulterating the food and drink that they
sold, and of those other great robbers, the heads of the army, who pillaged foreign
peoples while exposing their own country to terrible reprisals? Finally shall I speak
of the innumerable means of amassing money at the expense of others, and of the innumerable
individuals in almost all classes who daily practiced them?
</p>
<p>“Not all these acts were classed as thefts by the law. The most inexcusable, the most
harmful, those which were only practiced by the rich, even enjoyed legal impunity.
But all of them were, nevertheless, in reality according to the rules of a sound morality,
thefts. Each class presented, without doubt, many exceptions. There were some rich
men as honest as possible, and many workers and poor men were persons of probity;
but it may be said that by force of circumstances, and as an irresistible consequence
of the inequality of fortune, <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>all men, rich and poor, were generally induced to commit actions which were in reality
only a kind of theft.
</p>
<p>“And often theft led to all kinds of cruelty, to murder, and even to the most barbarous
tortures in order to make owners reveal where they had hidden their gold. How many
poisonings and parricides did the thirst for gold or inheritance excite! Thieves kidnapped
children in order to prostitute them. They even stole and murdered young people in
order to sell the flesh of their corpses!
</p>
<p>“In a word, neither confidence nor security was possible. Each individual saw enemies
in almost all the others; and society seemed, as it were, but a haunt of cut-throats
in the midst of a forest! And all these horrors, which you will find more or less
everywhere, were with us, and are still elsewhere—I cannot repeat it too often—the
inevitable result of the unrestricted right of property.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2094src" href="#xd31e2094">28</a>

<p class="first">Among the disastrous consequences which industrial capitalism draws in its train the
author ranks the tremendous increase of criminality. In his “Condition of the Working
Class in England” he says: “The failings of the workers in general may be traced to
an unbridled thirst for pleasure, to want of providence, and of flexibility in fitting
into the social order, to the general inability to sacrifice the pleasure of the moment
to a remoter advantage. But is that to be wondered at? When a class can purchase only
a few and only the most sensual pleasures by its wearying toil, must it not give itself
over blindly and madly to those pleasures? A class about whose education no one troubles
himself, which is a playball to a thousand chances, knows no security in life—what
incentives has such a class to providence, to ‘respectability’, to sacrifice the pleasure
of the moment for a remoter enjoyment, most uncertain precisely by reason of the perpetually
varying, shifting conditions under which the proletariat lives? A class which bears
all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages, one to
which the social system appears in purely hostile aspects—who can demand that such
a class respect this social order? Verily that is asking much! But the working-man
cannot escape the present arrangement of society so long as it exists, and when the
individual worker resists it, the greatest injury falls upon himself.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Thus the social order makes family life almost impossible for the worker. In a comfortless,
filthy house, hardly good enough for mere nightly shelter, ill-furnished, often neither
rain-tight nor warm, a foul atmosphere filling rooms overcrowded with human beings,
no domestic comfort is possible. The husband works the whole day through, perhaps
the wife also and the elder children, all in different places; they meet night and
morning only, all under perpetual temptation to drink; what family life is possible
under such conditions? Yet the working-man cannot escape from the family, must live
in the family, and the consequence is a perpetual succession of family troubles, domestic
quarrels, most demoralizing for parents and children alike. Neglect of all domestic
duties, neglect of the children, especially, is only too common among the English
working-people, and only too vigorously fostered by the existing institutions of society.
And children growing up in this savage way, amidst these demoralizing influences,
are expected to turn out goody-goody and moral in the end! Verily the requirements
are naïve, which the self-satisfied bourgeois makes upon the working-man!
</p>
<p>“The contempt for the existing order is most conspicuous in its extreme form—that
of offenses against the law. If the influences demoralizing to the working-man act
more powerfully, more concentratedly than usual, he becomes an offender as certainly
as water abandons the fluid for the vaporous state at 80 degrees, <span class="corr" id="xd31e2109" title="Source: Reaumur">Réaumur</span>. Under the brutal and brutalizing treatment of the bourgeoisie, the working-man becomes
precisely as much without volition as water, and is subject to the laws of nature
with precisely the same necessity; at a certain point all freedom ceases. Hence with
the extension of the proletariat, crime has increased in England, and the British
nation has become the most criminal in the world. From the annual criminal tables
of the Home Secretary, it is evident that the increase of crime in England has proceeded
with incomprehensible rapidity. The number of arrests for <i>criminal</i> offenses reached in years: 1805, 4,605; 1810, 5,146; 1815, 7,898; 1820, 13,710; 1825,
14,437; 1830, 18,107; 1835, 20,731; 1840, 27,187; 1841, 27,760; 1842, 31,309 in England
and Wales alone. That is to say, they increased seven-fold in thirty-seven years.
Of these arrests, in 1842, 4,497 were made in Lancashire alone, or more than 14 per
cent. of the whole; and 4,094 in Middlesex, including London, or more than 13 per
cent. So that two districts which include great cities with proletarian populations,
produced one fourth of the total amount of crime, though their population is far from
forming one fourth of the whole. Moreover, the criminal <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>tables prove directly that nearly all crime arises within the proletariat; for in
1842, taking the average, out of 100 criminals, 32.35 could neither read nor write;
58.32 read and wrote imperfectly; 6.77 could read and write well; 0.22 had enjoyed
a higher education, while the degree of education of 2.34 could not be ascertained.
In Scotland, crime has increased yet more rapidly. There were but 89 arrests for criminal
offenses in 1819, and as early as 1837 the number had risen to 3,176, and in 1842
to 4,189. In Lanarkshire, where Sheriff Alison himself made out the criminal report,
the population has doubled in thirty years, and crime in five and a half, or six times
more rapidly than the population. The offenses, as in all civilized countries, are,
in the great majority of cases, against property. The proportion of offenses to the
population, which in the Netherlands is as 1 : 7,140, and in France as 1 : 1,804,
was in England, when Gaskell wrote, as 1 : 799. The proportion of offenses against
persons to the population in the Netherlands, 1 : 28,904; in France, 1 : 17,537; in
England, 1 : 23,395; that of crimes in general to the population in the agricultural
districts, as 1 : 1,043; in the manufacturing districts as 1 : 840. (‘Manufacturing
Population of England’, chap. 10.) In the whole of England today the proportion is
1 : 660; though it is scarcely ten years since Gaskell’s book appeared!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2116src" href="#xd31e2116">29</a>

of wealth, being so much toward equality, excessive wealth and excessive poverty being
removed, almost all the temptations, all the motives, which now urge to the commission
of crime, would be also removed.” In general, the English socialists from the commencement

the village of New Lanark. The disastrous consequences of industrial capitalism, such
as excessive hours of labor, insufficient nourishment, unsanitary housing, the lack

the population of the colony, though originally alcoholized and demoralized by capitalism,
little by little the favorable environment made itself felt, so that for nineteen
years there was no judicial prosecution, and drunkenness and illegitimate births disappeared.

<p class="first">In his “<span lang="fr">Essai sur la statistique morale de la France</span>”, the author has made a study of the influence of age, sex, season, education, etc.,
upon criminality. But there is scarcely to be found an exposition of the influence
of economic conditions upon the subject which we are considering. The following passages,
however, are not devoid of interest.
</p>
<p>“Wealth, (as determined by the amount of taxes on personal and real property) more
often than density of population, coincides with crimes against property, of which
it thus appears to be an indirect cause. We shall observe, however, that while the
maximum of wealth falls in the departments of the North, where the greatest number
of crimes against property are found; and the minimum in the center where these crimes
are most rare; yet in the South the average is almost as high as in the North. Now
if in the North is wealth which indirectly produces the crimes against property, why
is it that the same is not true of the South? It would be unsafe to conclude from
the fact that the poorest departments are those where the fewest crimes against property
are committed, that poverty is not the principal cause of these crimes. In order to
justify this conclusion, which in other regards we are far from rejecting, more direct
proofs would be necessary. As a matter of fact, it is possible that the departments
where there is the least wealth are not those where there are the greatest number
of the very poor; and that the departments where the largest fortunes are to be found
are just those where the poverty of a part of the population is greatest.
</p>
<p>“The question of the effect of wealth or poverty upon morality <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>presents more difficulty than one would suspect at first glance. To study it it would
be necessary to determine the ratio of the indigent and pauper class in each department.
Some documents upon the subject have been published, it is true, but they have no
authentic character, and do not appear to merit enough confidence for us to give the
analysis of them here.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2306src" href="#xd31e2306">1</a>
</p>
<p>Further along Guerry shows that the departments where commerce and manufacturing are
most highly developed furnish also the greatest number of crimes against property.
But the author has not investigated the connection between these two symptoms. Although
not rejecting, then, entirely the hypothesis that poverty is not the principal cause
of crimes against property, Guerry recognizes nevertheless that a causal connection
between poverty and crime is possible, that is to say he perceives that the department
where the greatest poverty prevails is not necessarily that which is the poorest,
nor that the richest is the one that has the fewest of the very poor.

<p class="first">An exposition of the whole system of this author would lead us too far. But the following
quotations from his “<span lang="fr">Physique sociale</span>” will suffice to show the breadth of his views and the vastness of his conception
of society.
</p>
<p>“Thus, to make our manner of procedure plain by an example, anyone who examines too
closely a small portion of a very great circumference traced upon a plane, will see
in this portion only a certain number of physical points, assembled in a more or less
accidental way.… From a greater distance his eye will take in a greater number of
points, which will already appear regularly distributed in an arc of a certain extent;
soon, if the observer continues to recede, he loses sight of the individual points
… grasps the law that has presided over their general arrangement, and recognizes
the nature of the curve traced.…
</p>
<p>“It is in this way that we shall study the laws that concern the human race; for when
we examine them from too near at hand it becomes impossible to grasp them; we are
struck only with individual peculiarities, which are infinite.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2324src" href="#xd31e2324">2</a>
</p>
<p>“In all that relates to crimes, the same figures are reproduced with <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>such constancy that it is impossible to misconstrue them, even in the case of those
crimes which, it would seem, should be most likely to escape human prevision, such
as homicides, since these are in general committed as a consequence of quarrels arising
without motive, and under apparently fortuitous circumstances. Experience, however,
proves that not only is the annual number of homicides nearly constant, but that even
the weapons employed are used in the same proportions. What can be said then of crimes
that are the result of reflection?
</p>
<p>“This constancy with which the same crimes reappear annually in the same order, and
lead to the same penalties in the same proportions, is one of the most curious of
the facts that we learn from court statistics.… A budget which we pay with frightful
regularity is that of the jails, the penitentiaries, and the gallows.… We can enumerate
in advance how many individuals will stain their hands with the blood of their fellows,
how many will be forgers, how many poisoners; almost as we can predict the births
and deaths.…
</p>
<p>“Society contains within itself the germs of all the crimes that are about to be committed.
It is society, in a way, which prepares them, and the criminal is only the instrument
that executes them.
</p>
<p>“Every social state supposes, then, a certain number and certain order of crimes as
a necessary consequence of its organization. This remark, which might appear discouraging
at first sight, becomes consoling, on the contrary, when we consider it more closely,
since it shows the possibility of the improvement of men, by the modification of their
institutions and habits and whatever, in general, influences their manner of being.
At bottom this is only the extension of the well known law … that so far as the same
causes are present we must expect the repetition of the same effects. What has produced
the belief that this did not apply to moral phenomena is the too great influence commonly
ascribed to man in matters relating to his actions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2335src" href="#xd31e2335">3</a>
</p>
<p>In the second volume of the “<span lang="fr">Physique sociale</span>”, Quetelet studies the influence of climate, age, and sex upon the tendency to crime.
Although he merely touches upon our subject and treats it only indirectly, the following
passages are worth the trouble of quoting:
</p>
<p>“Poverty also is very generally regarded as leading to evil; however the department
of the Creuse, one of the poorest in France, is that which shows in every respect,
the highest morality. In the same way in the Netherlands, the most moral province
is Luxemburg, <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>where there is most poverty reigning. We must, however, be clear about the word <i>poverty</i>, which is here employed with a significance to which exception may be taken. A province
is not really poor for having less extreme wealth than another, if the inhabitants,
as in Luxemburg, are sober and industrious; if, by their labor, they succeed in providing
in a dependable way for their needs, and in satisfying tastes that are so much the
more modest, as the inequality of fortune is less felt, and causes less temptation;
it may be said with more justice that this province enjoys a modest competence. Poverty
makes itself felt in the provinces where great wealth is piled up, as in Flanders,
Holland, the department of the Seine, etc., and especially in manufacturing countries,
where the slightest political disturbance, the slightest obstruction in the channels
of trade, will suddenly reduce thousands from a state of well-being to one of distress.
It is these sudden changes from one state to another that give birth to crime, especially
if those who suffer from them are surrounded by temptations, and are irritated by
the continual sight of luxury and an inequality of fortune that makes them desperate.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2349src" href="#xd31e2349">4</a>
</p>
<p>In speaking of the three races that make up the population of France, Quetelet says:
</p>
<p>“The most remarkable anomaly that the Celtic race seems to present is found in the
departments that belong to the valley of the Seine, especially below Paris. Several
causes contribute to bring this about. We shall note first that these departments
are those which, by reason of their extent, contain most persons and things, and consequently
offer most opportunities to commit crimes; it is there that there is most movement
and that most vagrants flow in from all districts.… Finally, it is here also that
we find most industrial establishments and these establishments support a congested
population whose means of support are more precarious than in other vocations.… The
commercial and industrial provinces of the Netherlands are likewise those in which
most offenses are committed.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2358src" href="#xd31e2358">5</a>

<p class="first">One of the parts of his “<span lang="fr">Paupérisme dans les Flandres</span>” treats of the criminality in the two provinces of that name. We quote the following
from it:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Criminality is the inseparable companion of poverty. As the number of indigent persons
increases, we see the number of crimes also increase. Hunger is a bad counselor. In
the midst of crushing destitution, a man gradually loses the notion of justice and
injustice, of good and bad; beset by needs that he cannot satisfy, he disregards the
laws, and ends by recoiling from no attempt that appears capable of bettering his
condition. Visiting a prison is enough to convince one of the influence of this cause
upon the number and the nature of the offenses, and before even questioning the statistics
that attest the progress of criminality in Flanders, we could be assured that this
progress had coincided with that of pauperism. It is not then a demonstration (which
we judge quite unnecessary) that we are about to offer here, it is only a series of
facts that may serve to make the reader appreciate the greatness of the evil and the
urgent necessity of attacking its source.
</p>
<p>“The first of these facts is the high figure for convicts belonging to East and West
Flanders, when compared with the total number of convicts in the central prisons.…
In the ten years between <span class="corr" id="xd31e2376" title="Source: 1858">1838</span> and 1847, 23,075 convicts were received in the central prisons of the kingdom; 10,308
belonged to the two Flanders and 12,767 to the other provinces; the proportion, to
1000 convicts, was 447 for the first two provinces, and 553 for the seven others.
Now this proportion is considerably in excess of that of the respective populations
of the two divisions, since, to the thousand inhabitants, there are only 331 in Flanders
and 669 in the rest of the kingdom. In other words, during the decennial period in
question, one prisoner was received to 139 inhabitants in Flanders, and to 227 in
the seven other provinces.
</p>
<p>“The second fact is the increase in the number of persons arraigned and convicted
in the Flemish provinces during the last few of these years, and particularly since
the food shortage of 1845. In a space of seven years, the number of those arraigned
in the two Flanders increased about in the ratio of 7 to 17; that of those condemned
to imprisonment grew, during the same period from 35 to 123, or nearly quadrupled.
</p>
<p>“These data are confirmed by an abstract of the numbers received into the jails and
prisons of the two provinces, as well as by the average population of these establishments,
during the period from 1839 to 1848:

<p>“Supposing that West Flanders, which has more dependents in proportion than East Flanders,
has the same proportion of children, we arrive at a total for the two provinces, of
225,894 indigent persons whose age is not above 18. In this number there are 174,588
who have not passed their twelfth year! And there are thousands of orphans!
</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding the improvement that begins to make itself felt, thanks to the resumption
of work and the low price of provisions, many of these young unfortunates continue
to give themselves up to begging and vagrancy. But lately driven from their homes
by cold and hunger, they form a wandering population, incessantly buffeted from almshouse
to almshouse, from prison to prison.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>“In Brussels at this present moment (July, 1849) there are still to be found in the
annex of the prison, about 250 mendicants, among whom are 97 children below the age
of 17. In the prisons of Ghent and Bruges their number is equally great.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2991src" href="#xd31e2991">6</a>
</p>
<p>“It is an established fact, then, that the increase of criminality in Flanders has
gone hand in hand with the extension of poverty. The latter brings about the abandonment
of homes; … from this come mendicity, vagrancy, marauding, and theft. The incarceration
of so great a number of unfortunates brings the most disastrous consequences. The
germs of corruption, brutality, and crime are continually injected into a large fraction
of the population. The habit of working is lost, energy is relaxed, idleness becomes
incurable. When we think especially of the mass of children who, during the last few
years, have passed through the prisons and almshouses, we cannot picture without pity,
mingled with fear, the future of this generation, initiated at an early age into the
existence of criminals, and condemned to the dangers and evils inseparable from the
abandonment and degradation to which they are a prey.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2996src" href="#xd31e2996">7</a>

<p>“Thus in a space of thirty-four years the number of crimes has more than doubled in
England, while, in the same interval, the increase of the population has hardly passed
40%.
</p>
<p>“The parallelism between the growing pauperism and growing criminality is even more
striking when the comparison is applied to the delinquents under the summary jurisdiction
of the justices of the peace. Up to the time of the establishment of the workhouses
in 1834 the number of poor persons assisted increased progressively from year to year.
Well, the number of persons arrested by the metropolitan police followed the same
progression. This number was 72,824 in 1831, and 77,543 in 1832. In 1833 the new poor
law with its terrible workhouses was approaching; consequently the number of arrests
was no more than 69,959. In 1834 the law was promulgated, and up to 1838 was executed
with great rigor; as a result the number of arrests fell to 64,269 in 1834, to 63,674
in 1835, and to 63,584 in 1836. In 1837 the severity began to relax; consequently
the number of arrests increased to 64,416. In 1839 the laxity continued, and the number
of arrests increased to 70,717. Laxity reached its height in 1842, and the number
of arrests rose to 76,545; this was an arrest to each 25 of the population.
</p>
<p>“In Newcastle in 1837 the magistrates sentenced 1 person to 24 of the whole population.
In Leeds during a period of six years, from 1833 to 1838, there was one person arrested
to 32 of the population. In Manchester in 1841 … the ratio of persons arrested, to
the population, was as 1 to 21.… In 1831, ten years earlier, the proportion was still
only 1 to 78. It almost quadrupled, then, in the interval. In Liverpool in 1840 there
was one arrest to 12 inhabitants.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3080src" href="#xd31e3080">9</a>

<p class="first">The statistical data that form the basis of Dr. Mayr’s “<span lang="de">Statistik der gerichtlichen <span class="corr" id="xd31e3093" title="Source: Politzei">Polizei</span> im Königreiche Bayern und in einigen anderen Ländern</span>” are different from those used in similar works. For, while generally only the number
of crimes whose authors have been convicted, or that of delinquents punished, are
considered, Dr. Mayr is of the opinion that to obtain a true picture of the morality
of a people, it is necessary to take into account the number of crimes known to the
police. “If we wish really to form an exact picture of <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>the moral condition of a people, we must first of all ask ourselves the question,
how great is the number of the cases of crimes of different kinds that are of common
notoriety, before we ask how great is the number of the individuals who are convicted
of these crimes. The immorality of a people is determined not by the number of individuals
convicted, but by the number of crimes committed; else that people would be most moral
in which no offender ever let himself be caught, even if more crimes were committed
there than elsewhere.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3099src" href="#xd31e3099">10</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Bavaria.
</p>
<p>The results of Dr. Mayr’s researches in regard to crime in this country are shown
by him in a number of charts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3106src" href="#xd31e3106">11</a>
</p>
<p><i>Cis-Rhenal Territory.</i> A comparison of the curves for crimes against property and those for crimes against
persons shows us that the first descends as the other ascends, and vice versa. In
seeking for the causes we find that in general the motives for the latter class of
crime are, among others, coarseness, passion, and dissoluteness, while that of the
first kind of crime is the desire to secure objects for direct use. The more difficult
it is to gain a livelihood in a lawful manner, the more this tendency will develop.
</p>
<p>According to the author, the fluctuation in the price of grain is one of the most
important factors bearing upon criminality. And indeed, in examining his nine statistical
charts the connection between the high or the low cost of grain, and the great or
the small number of offenses against property comes out clearly. The curve for offenses
against persons, on the other hand, falls when the price of grain rises, and vice
versa. The improvement of living conditions, both subjectively (through having the
means to purchase the necessaries) and objectively (through a fall in prices) must
consequently exercise a considerable influence upon criminality. This is seen very
well in the last years of the period 1835–61, when the price of grain was low, and
wages very generally increased. Hence, from 1857 on, there was an increase in the
crimes against persons, and a decrease in the crimes against property.
</p>
<p>It ought to be remarked here that however just in itself Dr. Mayr’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>observation may be, we must beware of drawing the erroneous conclusion that those
who feel most strongly the influence of the fall of prices and the rise in wages must
necessarily, according to a law of nature, commit crimes against persons. This is
true only for gross and uncultivated individuals who do not know how to occupy their
leisure. But the degree of civilization of an individual depends above all upon the
economic conditions under which he was placed by his birth. There are, then, economic
causes for both kinds of crime.
</p>
<p><i>Upper Bavaria.</i> This district shows a higher figure for crime than any other province in Bavaria.
It is especially the great increase since 1857–1858 that is most striking, and which
is explained at least partially by the application of another system of examining
offenses. The increase in the number of crimes against the person is the consequence
of prosperous years, while the high figure for crimes against property is explained
by the great influx of individuals from neighboring districts, who, from an economic
standpoint, were not independent. In the period from 1837 to 1864 the population increased
49,128 by birth, and 66,299 by immigration.
</p>
<p><i>Lower Bavaria.</i> The connection between crimes against property and the price of grain is weaker in
this province than in any of the others, because of its great production of cereals,
which, for the most part, are destined for home consumption.
</p>
<p>The upper Palatinate, Upper, Central, and Lower Franconia, and Swabia, all give convincing
proofs of Dr. Mayr’s thesis, though in Franconia the truth is less apparent through
the fact that bad years brought increased emigration, which cut down the normal increase
in the number of crimes.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Where he treats of the different forms of crime, we read the following remarks, which
are of interest in connection with our subject: “As we have just seen, crimes against
persons increase when the price of grain goes up. We must except from this rule, however,
two kinds of crime: infanticide and abortion.” The first of these crimes reached its
maximum in the critical years 1854–55, and the second in 1853–1854.
</p>
<p>As a proof of the coincidence of the fluctuations of crimes against property with
those of the price of grain in the period preceding that which he studied especially,
Dr. Mayr gives the following table:

<p>In chapter IV (“<span lang="de">Zahl und Bewegung der Polizeiübertretungen im Gebiete diesseits des Rheins</span>”) Dr. Mayr gives some interesting information with regard to thefts of wood. The
following table gives the figures for these crimes in this district compared with
the others:

<p>The great difference between these figures is explained by the fact that in Lower
Franconia only a quarter of the woods are privately owned (the rest belonging to corporations,
etc.). In Upper Bavaria the private forests are 92%, and in Lower Bavaria 96½% of
the whole. Besides, the price of wood is very high in Lower Franconia. Once more,
then, economic conditions are the cause of crime.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Upon the movement of the figures for mendicity Dr. Mayr remarks that they are strongly
influenced by the cost of the primary necessities. “The parallel movement of the food-price
and mendicity offers little to astonish us if we learn from the statistics of crimes
that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>objective difficulty or ease of getting food resulting from the fluctuations in price,
exercises a direct influence upon increase and decrease of serious crimes against
property. It is explicable that only a small portion of individuals who become economically
dependent proceed to serious crime, while the majority fall into the minor misdemeanors
involved in a living obtained through begging and vagrancy. The same force that appears
in the increase and decrease of attacks upon property, must consequently appear much
more intensively in the fluctuations of mendicity and vagrancy.”

<p>However, in this case the increase of mendicity does not rest upon the high prices
alone, but also upon the crisis which, owing to the depression of the cotton industry
from 1860 on, lowered the plane of living of hundreds of thousands of workers, or
drove them into the street.

<p>The great fall in the price of grain in 1863–1864 is once more accompanied by a diminution
of the offenses against property, and an increase in those against persons.
</p>
<p>We might conclude from this table that the remark concerning crimes against property
and those against persons is not applicable, since in 1858 the number of crimes against
property was very high, notwithstanding the reduced price of grain. Here is Dr. Mayr’s
explanation of it:
</p>
<p>“The reason must be the following: The occasion for high spirits to be found in improved
living conditions follows immediately upon any such improvement, and disappears at
once when times grow worse. For this reason the fluctuation in attacks upon persons
harmonizes exactly with the fluctuation in the price of food. The effects of hard
times are only partially such as lead to punishable offenses; in most cases economic
ruin occurs first, which leads only after an interval to attacks upon property. For
this reason the effects of hard times continue to manifest themselves at a time when
the hard times themselves are already practically over. This is the explanation both
of the great number of attacks upon property in the year 1857, when the effects of
the immediately preceding hard times were making themselves felt, as well as the gradual
increase in the number of attacks against property in the years 1860–1862.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4788src" href="#xd31e4788">13</a>

of the high price of wheat, and of the crisis in the cotton industry.

<p>Here it is to be observed:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> that the movement of mendicity and vagrancy is not in direct correlation with that
of the price of grain.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> that Group IV shows only a slight correlation with the price of grain, since there
are included in it many crimes whose causes are not of an economic nature.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> that during the last years of this period the increase of crimes against property
was greater than the figures for the price of grain would lead one to suppose; a fact
which is explained, according to Dr. Mayr, by the lack of work resulting from the
war of secession.
</p>
<p>The law that crimes against persons increase with the fall of prices is confirmed
by these statistics.

<p class="first">According to this author the laws regulating moral phenomena are at present hidden
by thick clouds.
</p>
<p>“We may await with confidence the dissipation of these clouds, when some great principle,
about which our observations of detail will group themselves, will appear to us in
a flood of light. Everything seems to indicate to me that this master principle is
no other than the principle of activity. In fact, the first rudiments of social science
have as yet been given us only by political economy, and its sole foundation is the
affirmation of human activity. On the other hand, since giving myself up without any
preconceptions to this special study of criminality I have been little by little led
by a close examination of the facts, to find the general cause of crimes in the absence
of this principle of activity.
</p>
<p>“When we reflect upon this, it appears quite in the natural order of things that the
development of criminality, that is to say of the spirit of destruction and dissolution,
should manifest itself at the time of the weakening or disappearance of the generative
principle of all production and of all society. There is here, then, if I am not deceived,
more than a mere coincidence. There is a relationship which deserves to be noted so
much the more since it is from the principle of activity that all physical laws also
are derived today.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5457src" href="#xd31e5457">16</a>
</p>
<p>Let us accompany the author to the domain of facts. After having given an exposition
of the movement of criminality in France in <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>comparison with that of other countries, he finally takes up the question of etiology.
For the crowd, says the author, the criminal is a kind of monster in the midst of
society, a monster predestined to crime because of his innate tendencies. Looked at
in this way criminality is an individual evil. Corne, on the contrary, believes it
to be a social evil. For, however much society may be developed in all respects, it
is nevertheless always imperfect, since the ignorance and corruption of morals are
great. The author lays stress upon two facts, namely, the corruption of morals in
the upper classes, and militarism. Not only does militarism draw after it the ruin
of peoples, and develop man’s violent instincts, but it has still other very serious
moral consequences, by forcing celibacy upon young men at the passionate age.
</p>
<p>The author admits that there are facts which might seem to give the lie to his opinion—the
influence, for example, of the price of grain upon the decrease and increase of criminality.

<p>Although, according to Corne, the high price of grain may be only an accidental fact,
there must yet be some importance attached to it in view of the disastrous consequences
which may result from it to families that have in any case a hard time to make both
ends meet. But the figures given above do not prove the influence to be very great.
For prices rise sometimes although the other figures fall, and vice versa. And then
the sudden increase of [detected] crime from 1849 to 1853 must be attributed to a
better organization of the police.

</p>
<p>We see that the coincidence of the figures is here naturally greater than in the first
table.
</p>
<p>“The situation of criminals may be summed up in a word: <i>isolation</i>. Most of them hardly know what a family is. They are miserable, they have no home,
no fixed occupation which attaches them little by little to men and things. They are
immersed in the gloom of ignorance. Aside from what affects their immediate physical
wants the rest of the world is for them as if it did not exist.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5800src" href="#xd31e5800">17</a> They are alone, isolated from birth. For among juvenile prisoners there are reckoned
not only many illegitimate and orphaned children, but also many who have been deserted.
Out of 8006 young criminals in prison December 31st, 1864, 60% were illegitimate,
orphaned, or deserted.
</p>
<p>The author then depicts the environment in which the children of the proletariat ordinarily
grow up—bad hygienic conditions, demoralizing surroundings, etc.—and points out the
harmful effect of labor in factories upon the young. Corne also considers celibacy
to be one of the causes of crime, since the individual has no one to care for him
or be interested in his fate. Crime is developed much more in the great cities than
in the country, for the reason, the author thinks, that men are much more isolated,
much more left to themselves in the city than in rural neighborhoods.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>—Here I would remark that it is for economic reasons that men are prevented from marrying,
and that the great criminality of cities is best explained by the marked difference
in economic situation, and by the more frequent opportunities for wrong-doing found
there.—
</p>
<p>According to Corne one of the best preventives of crimes is property, since it engenders
a feeling of responsibility. The property owner exerts himself to increase his wealth,
and hence property has a moral influence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5810src" href="#xd31e5810">18</a>
</p>
<p>“Criminality comes from a lack of vitality. It is an anemia. In order to prevent it
we must excite a desire for activity.” It is in this that the usefulness of education
appears. The man who knows how to read and write, has in his hands an instrument which
can multiply his means of action indefinitely.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5815src" href="#xd31e5815">19</a>
</p>
<p>—As regards education, it has been proved that Corne and many others have exaggerated
its importance for the etiology of crime. When education extends beyond the art of
reading and writing, it has a civilizing influence, and causes a diminution of violent
crimes, but it does not result in a decrease of criminality in general, since the
economic causes of crime remain. Education changes, indeed, the nature of criminality,
but not its extent.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5820src" href="#xd31e5820">20</a>—
</p>
<p>The author concludes by saying “The man who has a family, who has property, who is
educated, who is known by his fellow citizens and has his share of influence upon
them, can not be the individual whom we have seen to be criminal, because of weakness
and isolation … he has energy, determination, and can control his passions because
he is surrounded and sustained, because a thousand bonds of interest and affection
attach him to society, order, and property.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5838src" href="#xd31e5838">21</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The work “<span lang="de">Das Verbrecherthum im Preussischen Staat</span>”, published in 1869 by Prison-director von Valentini, treats especially of the results
obtained by the penal system then in force in Prussia, and of the means of improving
it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>Von Valentini sees in crime primarily the consequence of social conditions, at least
he considers that the best means of combating it is for society to prevent the criminal
tendency from manifesting itself, and make efforts to raise the moral level of the
people. For, according to our author, 90% of the criminals are “purely material and
entirely neglected” and ought to “undergo a spiritual regeneration.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5855src" href="#xd31e5855">22</a>
</p>
<p>After these general observations he proceeds to more particular observations upon
the criminals themselves in society. He examines statistically the proportion of criminals
in the population. Obtaining different proportions for different districts of Prussia
he investigates the causes. For this purpose he classifies crimes as: first, crimes
from personal interest, and second, crimes from passion. Finding then that the provinces
of the East give 9% of crimes from personal interest more than the others, he thinks
he has found the cause in “an existing destitution both material and intellectual,
and in the arrangement of the prisons.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5860src" href="#xd31e5860">23</a>
</p>
<p>Chapter Three, upon the “<span lang="de">Dimensionen des Nothstandes</span>” contains detailed tables for each province, the great cities, and the rich and poor
countries. He obtains, then, the following result for the eight provinces:

<p>This table shows then: first, that crimes against property diminish as prices fall;
second, that under these same conditions crimes against morals and against persons
increase.
</p>
<p>—We must be on our guard, however, against drawing false conclusions from this second
fact. The relationship in question is observed only during a certain period and in
certain countries, and is not to be regarded as a law of nature, <i>i.e.</i>, it must not be understood that an improvement in economic conditions invariably
causes an increase in sexual and violent crimes. If this were the case, the well-to-do
classes, who are always in a position to provide for all their needs, would furnish
most of the criminals of this description. The facts show just the contrary to occur
everywhere. (See Part Two, where I treat this subject fully.)—
</p>
<p>In the chapter, “<span lang="de">Die social ethische Lebensbethätigung in der <span class="corr" id="xd31e6506" title="Source: bürgerlichaen">bürgerlichen</span> Rechtsphäre</span>,” the author treats our subject more fully. Reasoning from different data taken from
other authors, he points out the connection between economic conditions on the one
hand and vagabondage and mendicity on the other. Having shown a considerable <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>increase in these offenses in the revolutionary period of 1848, he attributes this
increase to the lack of social discipline, for the price of provisions was then low.
We pass all this part of von Oettingen’s book in silence, his data being taken for
the most part from other authors. We would merely point out his error in ranking the
year 1848 among those economically favorable because of the fall in the price of food.
As a matter of fact there was a terrible economic crisis in Europe at the time.

<p>We take the following data from the section entitled “<span lang="de"><span class="corr" id="xd31e6515" title="Source: Getreidepreis">Getreidepreise</span> und <span class="corr" id="xd31e6518" title="Source: Criminalität">Kriminalität</span></span>.”

<p>We find here this rule, that a rise in the price of food is accompanied by an increase
in the crimes against property and a decrease in crimes against persons, and vice
versa. This table also shows that, if a very pronounced rise in prices has caused
a great increase in criminality, the later fall in prices does not make itself felt
in the number of crimes until some time after its commencement. (See 1867–1868.)

<p>Here is another proof of the rule, then, that crimes against property decrease and
those against persons increase as prices fall.

<h3 class="label">IX.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">H. Stursberg.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the first part of a brochure edited in 1878 and entitled, “<span lang="de">Die Zunahme der Vergehen und Verbrechen und ihre Ursache</span>,” the author attempts, with the aid of statistics, to discover in what measure criminality
increased or decreased in Germany during the years 1871–1877. As a result of these
researches he finds a considerable increase in all Germany.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e6856src" href="#xd31e6856">29</a>
</p>
<p>As regards the causes of this increase, Stursberg, though not rejecting entirely the
opinion of Quetelet that society prepares the crime and that the criminal is only
the instrument that executes it, is nevertheless of the opinion that it is very necessary
to take into account the personal factor, <i>i.e.</i> the presence or absence of religious and moral sentiments.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are those, says the author, who seek the cause in the consequences of the war
against France. Although believing also that the war has had unfavorable effects upon
criminality, it is impossible, in his opinion that this war should be the cause of
the increase of criminality, since crime decreased after the wars of 1864 and 1866.
He considers that one of the causes is the great mildness of the penalties imposed
by the new penal code of the empire. But according to him, this is not important,
for since 1871 there has been rather a diminution than an increase of recidivism.
Nor can bad economic conditions be the cause, says Stursberg; for criminality had
already begun to increase before the bad years, and it is not theft that has increased
the most. Nevertheless, Stursberg recognizes that prolonged poverty weakens the moral
sentiments, which shows that criminality and poverty are closely connected.
</p>
<p>But there are, in his opinion, more serious causes. There follows a description of
the impetus taken by industry in Germany during the early seventies, a description
not easily surpassed in pointlessness, and in the naïve ignorance that it evinces.
Without comprehending the significance of the really important events that are happening
about him, the author fulminates against certain consequences of modern capitalism.
</p>
<p>—This appears to him as the consequence of a suddenly awakened desire for riches.
But why should this desire arise at this time? The author does not tell us. But notwithstanding
this he has unquestionably discovered here one of the principal causes, since the
prodigious increase of industry, shortly followed by the inevitable crisis, has infallibly
caused an increase in criminality. Since Stursberg treats this question rather as
a moralist than as a man of science, we have no interest in spending longer time upon
it.—
</p>
<p>In the first few pages of his brochure Stursberg speaks of the disastrous consequences
of alcoholism, after the enactment of the law of 1869, which increased the number
of spirit shops. Armed with quotations without number he combats in turn the cafés-chantants,
immoral literature, etc., etc.; after which he introduces all at once the matter of
professional liberty. He speaks of the “influence, impossible to estimate, which honest
and pious masters exercised for centuries upon the journeymen and apprentices, who
were like members of the family.” “The freedom of the trades came in and loosed the
bonds of piety and discipline which had retained the journeyman and apprentices in
the home of their master.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>—As far as we can see, the ideas of the author are rather those of a writer of the
Middle Ages, than of a contemporary of modern capitalism. It cannot be denied that
there is truth at the bottom of this reasoning. For it is incontestable that in the
time of the guilds the position of the journeymen was in general more favorable than
that of the proletariat today. But it does not follow that the religion of the master
was the cause of this. And a demonstration in which professional liberty is represented
as being in fact a legislative error, and not the logical and inevitable consequence
of the birth of modern capitalism, is so unscientific that it has no place in an investigation
into the causes of the increase of criminality.—
</p>
<p>Then he preaches more particularly against the greater and greater extension of the
study of the natural sciences, against social democracy, the lack of respect for constituted
authorities, etc., etc., without, however, alleging the slightest proof of the connection
of all this with the increase of crime. But at the end he says, “the fundamental cause
of the increase of crime is the rapid growth of irreligion, and the weakening of Christian
sentiment in church and school.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e6878src" href="#xd31e6878">30</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">L. Fuld.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before entering upon his special investigation, the author of “<span lang="de">Der <span class="corr" id="xd31e6892" title="Source: Einflusz">Einfluss</span> der Lebensmittelpreise auf die Bewegung der strafbaren Handlungen</span>” makes the following observation: Everywhere it is noted that assaults upon morals
with acts of violence increase when the price of provisions falls. Adhering to the
opinion of von Oettingen that “as the consequence of an increase of prosperity, the
tendency to crime shows itself more by crimes against morals than by those against
property”, Fuld also mentions the opinion of Valentini, that “in this case the people
become audacious and commit these crimes more easily.”
</p>
<p>Here are other salient facts; that the number of young criminals increases, and that
the city produces more criminals than the country, although the sexual morality especially
is far from ideal in the country. Finally in speaking of the influence of profession,
Fuld mentions that the increase in the number of criminals which accompanies a rise
in prices is greater for the first offenders than for recidivists. The following table
which he gives to prove this point, however, plainly fails to do so:

<p>The author explains that the crimes against property are one of the consequences of
the struggle for existence, a fact which accounts in part for the high figures for
criminality in the great cities, where competition is most intense. The author treats
of theft, and begins by saying that the connection between the price of provisions
and theft is very close.

<p>During the following years the prices fell. Nevertheless the number of thefts increased.
According to Fuld we can draw the conclusion that the influence of price is only relative!—This
table proves little. For, while in 1856 criminality attained its highest point, prices
were lower than in 1860; and, while the figures for theft diminished greatly, prices
remained constant.—

<p>Here there is some agreement between the number of thefts and prices. But it is not
as great as Fuld would make out. For example, notwithstanding the sudden rise on prices
in 1860, criminality diminished, while the year following there was a still further
fall in the thefts without violence.

<p>We can indeed find here some agreement between the two columns, but that is all that
can be said.
</p>
<p>Then the author says that differences in price are not as great as formerly, on account
of the development of international commerce. He gives a table of comparative prices
from 1870 to 1879 which shows that five staples show no consistent movement in price.
But during the same period theft was continually on the increase. The number of male
delinquents from 18 to 50 alone varies with prices; the figures for delinquents between
50 and 60 follow the course of prices but slightly. Other economic crimes show little
conformity.
</p>
<p>The final conclusion of Fuld upon crimes against property is: “The influence of the
price of provisions upon these offenses is quite important.” Although not giving my
opinion upon the correctness of this judgment at this time, I may say that the statistics
furnished by Fuld give almost no proof of it.
</p>
<p>The following part treats of crimes against life. It is evident that we are not concerned
with crimes of passion. The only ones that enter into consideration are those that
have an economic object. But since criminal statistics do not make this distinction,
the results of the author’s investigation can be but small. He is indeed convinced
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>that the influence of the price of provisions is very perceptible, but he does not
prove it. The same may be said with regard to sexual crimes.

<p>Just as the influence of the price of food makes itself felt in the number of marriages
and births, it is also visible in the figures for criminality. So, when the temperature
of the winter is very low (<i>e.g.</i> 1855, ’56, ’65, and ’71), since men have greater wants than ordinary, criminality
rises. Thefts of wood increase during these years, <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>for example. But it is in only one part of the year that the cold makes itself felt,
while the high price of food lasts the whole year. Hence the latter has much more
influence on criminality.

is also accompanied by a diminution in the number of crimes. When, at the close of
1858, the price of rye and potatoes begins to rise again, criminality also increases,
though not so much. We do not see this agreement during the years 1861–1865. While
prices rise in 1866, criminality declines as a consequence of the war with Austria,
and of economic events.
</p>
<p>The years 1870–1871, during which prices rose, show a fall in the figures for crime,
a second exception to the rule therefore, since 1866. At the close of 1875 criminality
increased greatly, although prices rose but little, and when, in 1877, prices begin
to come down, the curve for criminality goes on rising. As for the years 1870–1871,
the explanation is to be found in the war, which strengthened the feeling of solidarity
(as in a less degree in 1866). Further, the development of manufacturing had already
begun by the end of the war, and the war itself withdrew from ordinary life many persons
who, without it, might have committed crime. The author mentions also the great diminution
of crime in France during these years.
</p>
<p>We note, however, that the French statisticians (Lafargue, for example) consider these
years as of little importance in the study of criminality, since the police and the
courts were then much less active than at ordinary times. The same causes may be supposed
to have been active in Prussia also, though in a less degree than in France.
</p>
<p>At the close of the middle of this century manufacturing was but slightly developed
in Prussia. But after the war its development assumed gigantic proportions. Wealth
increased, but was not evenly distributed, as the following table from the income
tax returns shows:

<p>There were 96% of the population, then, with no education or only an elementary one.
</p>
<p>Little by little manufacturing so forged ahead of agriculture that the necessary food
was no longer produced in the country. From this time dates the importation of large
quantities of grain.
</p>
<p>The year 1873 saw the beginning of the terrible reaction that made itself felt in
all strata of the population. The number of marriages diminished as well as the number
of births, and criminality increased. (See Plate I.)
</p>
<p>At first the curves for theft and criminality in general run parallel in their rising
and falling. But with 1854 they begin to diverge, and this divergence is especially
plain from 1871 on. Consequently something else must have had an influence upon criminality.
And this other thing, according to Starke, is the modification of the political position
of the people. According to him the participation of the mass of the people in politics,
made possible by the right of suffrage, has been one of the causes of the increase
of the number of crimes against the authority of the state, as the socialistic movement
has been a second cause.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8283src" href="#xd31e8283">33</a>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>—Without doubt the participation of all classes in the political life will lead to
crimes, especially when in the strife of classes the propertied class makes use of
violent means. The assertion that the socialistic movement causes many crimes has
only a semblance of truth. It is rather because of the manner in which the socialists
are treated, than because of their doctrine that they are driven to acts of <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>violence. For the socialists wish to attain their end by pacific and legal, political
and economic means, and it is only when they are opposed by force that they are incited
to the use of violent means.—

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Starke finally draws the following conclusion as to the causes in the movement in
criminality: “Hardly ever in the short space of a generation have so many mighty factors
of different kinds influenced the life of our people, as in the years from 1848 to
1878; a complete metamorphosis of the courts and the police; so extraordinary an increase
in the numbers and density of the population that the soil could no longer produce
enough to feed such numbers; connected with this a great development of manufacturing
with repeated crises, brought on by the high price of the necessaries of life, and
by epidemics; the development of intercourse and commerce world-wide in extent; bloody
wars, which, through the system of universal military service, disturb the whole population
of every class; a politico-economic crisis so severe that there has been none like
it hitherto; and in addition to and at the same time with all these factors, the entrance
of the people into the exercise of political rights; and finally, dependent upon these,
a deep-seated socialistic agitation.
</p>
<p>“All these factors have their part in the moulding of the life of the people in good
as well as bad directions and accordingly influence the movement of criminality. In
the first rank stand the effects upon the physical life of the lack of warmth and
nourishment. The great significance of the coldness of the winter upon the increase
and decrease of the theft of wood has been noted. Much greater is the effect of the
anxiety about daily bread, which finds expression in the movement of the price of
provisions.… Parallel with the curve of food-prices runs that of thefts and the movement
of the latter is again impressed upon the curve of crimes and misdemeanors in general.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8325src" href="#xd31e8325">34</a> Let us consider now some of the important kinds of crime.
</p>
<p class="subheading"><i>Offenses and contraventions against property.</i>
</p>
<p>“It is egoism which chiefly governs man, shows itself positively in the desire to
acquire as much as possible, and negatively in the desire to lose as little as possible,
and which reduces activity to insatiability, and economy to avarice.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8333src" href="#xd31e8333">35</a> Now, cupidity leads to most of the crimes against property, while hatred, vengeance,
etc. drive men to malicious mischief.
</p>
<p>Examining now Plates II and III, the influence of the years of high prices (1856 and
1867), of the years of war (1866 and 1870–1871), and <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>of the years of crisis shows itself very plainly. It is to be noted that the curve
of crimes of “malicious mischief” takes a course totally different from that of crimes
against property committed from other motives. Plate III shows the great influence
of economic events upon fraudulent bankruptcies (1857 and 1873 having been years of
crisis).
</p>
<p class="subheading"><i>Offenses against persons.</i>
</p>
<p>We see that the curves of these crimes shown upon Plates IV and V have a course quite
different from that of the curves of the crimes against property. It is only in 1870
that both fall together. Starke deduces the rule, confirmed by many statisticians,
that an improvement in economic conditions is accompanied by an increase in assaults,
etc., and vice versa. The facts confirm this rule during the first part of the period
that Starke has studied, but not later. (Compare Plates I and IV.)
</p>
<p>In studying the curve of infanticide we note that it reaches the highest point in
the bad years, 1857, 1863, 1866, 1867 (Eastern Prussia), and 1868. In 1857 the first
commercial crisis took place, and in 1864 and 1866 the cholera raged and war was declared;
a number of fathers of illegitimate children died, leaving the mothers unable to support
the children.
</p>
<p>A comparison between the curve of crimes of arson, with those of the crimes against
property in Plate III, committed with the same end, shows a great resemblance; the
increase in this crime also shows itself in bad years.

</p>
<p>I cannot show the views of the author better than by quoting the following: “That
the number of offenses against property must be related to the prevailing economic
conditions, seems to need no proof. For the man who lives in the possession of abundance,
the motive for appropriating the property of others is lacking, even though the inclination
to commit all possible crimes slumbers within him. It is a favorite expression of
the Social-democrats, that the abolition of private property would cause all crimes
against property to disappear. They forget, while maintaining this, the probability
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>that just as earlier private individuals were robbed, so under the new order the state
would be, by people of the same kind—those who today, without living in want, still
are not content with their lawful gains, and reach out after unlawful ones. The apostles
of state-ownership, in order to make their contention credible, must at least offer
proof that the offenses against property which are now punished, are <i>entirely</i> due to hunger and need on the part of those convicted. They cannot however, offer
such proof. This is not because the government statistics … give no data with regard
to the economic condition of the convicts, but because, as a matter of fact, the worst
offenses against property are not committed by the hungry. The merchant who goes into
a fraudulent bankruptcy, the banker who embezzles deposits, the worldling who forges
drafts, have all taken the step into crime from a life, if not of abundance, at least
of a competence. People of this kind will not disappear from the socialistic state.
In their case the lack is not in the social system, but in their individual make-up.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8373src" href="#xd31e8373">37</a>

<p>—We have given this quotation simply to furnish a typical example of the incorrect
way in which many authors represent the socialistic opinion with regard to the genesis
of crime. What nonsense, to assert that according to the theory of socialism all crimes
against property find their causes in hunger and misery! See the second part of this
work, where the reader will find that socialists hold an entirely different opinion,
and that they have facts to prove the truth of their theories.—

<p>There is at first a certain correlation between the figures in the different columns,
but there is none in the later years. It is very probable that the diminution in crimes
against property is due, during these years, to a combination of favorable economic
circumstances at that time.

<p class="first">The second section of the second chapter of the work, “<span lang="de">Die Verbrechen in ihrem Zusammenhang mit dem <span class="corr" id="xd31e8539" title="Source: wirthschaftlichen">wirtschaftlichen</span> und sozialen Verhältnissen im Kanton Zürich</span>”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8543src" href="#xd31e8543">38</a> treats of the influence of the price of provisions and crop-returns (see Plate I).
</p>
<p>The author first calls attention to the years 1853–1861. We see that the curves of
the price of cereals and of offenses against property are then quite closely parallel.
However, the curve of the price of cereals was lowest in 1858, and that of offenses
in 1859. It is a well-known fact that economic phenomena make their influence upon
criminality felt only after some time. Further, it is only by the following year that
a part of the offenses are counted in the criminal statistics. Crimes against persons
increase when prices fall, and vice versa. The less the price of food is influenced
by bad industrial conditions, the more its influence upon criminality will strike
the eye.
</p>
<p>The section following is entitled: “<span lang="de">Schuldbetreibungs- und Konkurs-statistik als Ausdruck der wirtschaftlichen Lage der
Bevölkerung und Kriminalität</span>.” When we examine Plate II for the period 1832–1852, we see that the curves of bankruptcy
and of offenses against property are parallel. From Plate III (1852–1892) we note
that offenses against property are influenced by failures as well as by the price
of grain. At times the two forces act in the same direction and reënforce one another,
and at times their direction is opposite, and they more or less neutralize each other.
It must be remarked that in 1867 an epidemic of cholera raged in the canton, and that
the relief fund which was then given out kept the figure for criminality below what
the economic situation would have produced.

</p>
<p>Dr. Meyer’s conclusion from what has been said is this: “The result of the researches
proves that in the course of years the number of crimes against property is strictly
bound up with material conditions; the greater the difficulty of getting a living,
the more numerous <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>the crimes against property. The statistics of crimes against property show at the
same time the degrees of the prosperity of the country, as the statistics of failures,
for example, prove.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8570src" href="#xd31e8570">39</a>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Plate IV gives a comparison of crimes against persons with economic conditions, and
shows that these crimes increase when economic conditions improve, and that vintages
more or less abundant are not without importance.
</p>
<p>On page 44, the author commences his examination of the criminality in the different
districts of the canton of Zürich, investigating its distribution, both as to where
the crimes are committed, and where the criminals come from.
</p>
<p>According to the first distribution the districts of Zürich, of Dielsdorf, and of
<span class="corr" id="xd31e8585" title="Source: Horgan">Horgen</span> have the highest figures; those of Hinweill, of Meilen, and of Pfäffikon the lowest.
According to the second distribution it is again the districts of Dielsdorf and of
<span class="corr" id="xd31e8588" title="Source: Horgan">Horgen</span> that have the highest figures, while Hinweill, Meilen, and Pfäffikon take the last
place here also. Zürich and Winterthür, which in the first distribution held the first
place, in the second have the eighth and tenth. We see from this that, however great
the number of crimes the last two districts produce, the authors of the crimes are
outsiders.
</p>
<p>Dr. Meyer then compares the districts of Hinweill and Pfäffikon, which have the lowest
figures, with the districts of Horgen and Dielsdorf, which have the highest. He concludes
that the two former districts are the poorest, and the two latter the most well-to-do,
a conclusion which he bases upon different facts, among others upon the appropriations
which the public charities of the different districts receive from the state. And
according to him it follows that in this case the connection between criminality and
economic conditions is not direct.
</p>
<p>The author then explains the indirect connection as follows: “In Hinweill as in Pfäffikon,
there exists a general impoverishment, caused by the unfavorable state of the soil
and of the population, heavy mortgages, bad cultivation by the small farmers, the
diminution of industry, the lack of education, etc,—an impoverishment that threatens
the ruin of entire communities.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8595src" href="#xd31e8595">40</a> Then, an increase of crime is not to be feared in countries where poverty strikes
the whole population, for the thief has nothing to steal. Since in the well-to-do
districts the differences of possessions are more marked, the opportunity for wrong-doing
is greater, and it is this which makes criminality greater also.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>The conclusion of Dr. Meyer upon what has gone before is this: “Criminality is an
historical product, and economic conditions are only one, though a significant, factor.
Under like economic conditions … the number of crimes against property need not necessarily
be like. It depends upon how the population has accommodated itself to the economic
situation, whether it makes higher or lower demands upon life, what views it holds
as to the end of human existence, etc.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8601src" href="#xd31e8601">41</a>
</p>
<p>As to the occupations of those convicted the data of Dr. Meyer are incomplete. The
conclusion drawn from them is that the agricultural population is less criminal than
the industrial proletariat. Here is the reason, according to Dr. Meyer: “An explanation
of this phenomena that agrees fully with our investigations has already been given
by von Valentini when he says: ‘Small holdings make direct and exhausting demands
upon the labor of the whole family, while, on the other hand, they provide sufficiently
for the immediate and indispensable needs of the household, so that idleness as well
as anxiety about sustenance are generally both excluded from such a family.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8606src" href="#xd31e8606">42</a>
</p>
<p>“It is otherwise in manufacturing. The greater independence of the industrial worker,
his receiving his wages in money exclusively, the dependence of industry upon the
conjunctures of the market, give instead of the stability of existence, enjoyed by
agriculture, a life fluctuating and insecure. Abundance as well as want visits industrial
workers, and each of the two begets in him a corresponding kind of crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8611src" href="#xd31e8611">43</a>
</p>
<p>—The expression “abundance” as describing the state in which the proletariat live,
is a strange one. A man who is not indigent and has a few sous does not on that account
live in abundance. The author adds a quotation from Garofalo to point out how the
proletariat spend a great part of their “abundance” in the wine-shops. The reader
is, however, referred to Part II of this work, where I have pointed out the social
and economic causes of alcoholism.—
</p>
<p>Dr. Meyer concludes his work by saying that he does not believe that an improvement
of economic conditions will inevitably lead to an increase of crimes against persons,
but that the causes of them are rather to be found in frivolity, grossness, and dissipation
consequent upon an improvement of conditions.

<p class="first">“<span lang="de">Die sozialen Wirkungen der Handelskrisen in England</span>”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8650src" href="#xd31e8650">44</a> by this author, aims to prove that the commercial crises in England in the years
1823–1850 had a much more violent character than those of the years 1871–1896, which
occurred less suddenly, and made themselves felt for a long time afterwards. Since
criminality is one of the social phenomena pointed out as caused by these crises,
it is worth while giving a résumé of the work in question.
</p>
<p>Dr. Tugan-Baranowsky has examined the influence that commercial crises have exercised,
first, upon the agricultural counties, Cambridge, Essex, Norfolk, Oxford, Lincoln,
Suffolk and Wilts (Diagrams 1 and 4); second, upon the industrial counties of Lancaster
and Chester (Diagrams 2 and 5); third, upon all England (Diagrams 3 and 6).
</p>
<p>Let us study the first three diagrams. The first shows that the commercial crisis
of 1825 had a very slight effect upon criminality. It was the high price of grain
in 1829 that made crime increase. The same effect was produced by the famous law of
1834 (by which not only was the aid given to poor working people very much limited,
but which prescribed the placing in work-houses of those who were without means of
support) and by the crisis of 1836. In 1844–1845, years of good harvests, criminality
declined, after which the bad crops of 1847 brought about a contrary effect.
</p>
<p>We note from Diagrams 2 and 3 that the effect of commercial crises was much greater
in the manufacturing than in the agricultural counties (more plainly seen in 2 than
in 3). The crisis of 1825 made the curve of criminality rise considerably; the favorable
years 1833–1836 made it descend from 1834 on; while the crisis of 1836 caused a considerable
increase in the number of crimes in 1837. The bad years 1840–1843 caused a formidable
increase in the criminal population, which must also be attributed, at least in part,
to the Chartist movement. The favorable period that followed had the contrary effect.
It is interesting to compare the curves (in Diagram 3) of exports and crime, which
cross continually.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us consider now the last three diagrams. Dr. Tugan-Baranowsky attributes the descent
of the curve of criminality in Diagram 4 to the improved condition of the agricultural
population. Further, the number of crimes was greatly diminished by the alteration
in the criminal procedure in 1879, and it goes without saying that this influence
must also be taken into account in studying the last two diagrams. By Diagrams 5 and
6 we see that the influence of criminality is much less marked. Thus, for example,
the diminution of criminality was not prevented by the crisis at the beginning of
the period 1890–1896.
</p>
<p>The final conclusion of Dr. Tugan-Baranowsky is this: “The first three diagrams give
a picture of the life of the English people in the second quarter of this century
[the nineteenth]. We see abrupt periodical changes of important phenomena in the life
of the people, which are plainly connected with the changes in the industrial situation.
Especially sudden are the variations in the life of the industrial population. Each
crisis has a devastating effect upon the ranks of the working-classes, the workhouses
are swamped with the unemployed, the prisons fill up as well, mortality mounts enormously,
the mass of people out of work readily take up with any political agitation, and the
years of crisis are likewise years of revolutionary movements.
</p>
<p>“At the same time the manufacturing and commerce of the country increase rapidly.
The enormous growth of exportation in England, the curve of which mounts continually,
is in sharp contrast with the deterioration of the living-conditions of the working-class.
</p>
<p>“The last three diagrams show us an entirely different picture. English exports no
longer increase. In place of a steady rise of the curve with a sharp depression in
the critical years, there are regular, wave-like variations in the same plane. The
industrial development of the country proceeds at a slackening pace.
</p>
<p>“And at the same time in the life of the people there are signs to be noticed of increasing
well-being. Mortality, criminality, and pauperism fall quickly. Crises no longer have
their former influence upon the condition of the people. Even in manufacturing districts
business stagnation no longer has its former disastrous effect upon the working-class;
crime and the death-rate no longer increase, and even the increase in the number of
paupers is hardly noticeable. Organized labor supports even the unemployed. Wages
are only a little lower in years of industrial depression than they are in a time
of prosperity!”

<p class="first">At the end of his study the author gives the following table, which contains some
data upon the relation between the price of grain and abundance of the crops, on the
one hand, and criminality on the other. The figures in the second column have to do
with the different kinds of theft. The law of May 18th, 1882, having considerably
modified the penal code, the figures for the years 1882 and 1883 cannot be compared

<p>According to the author it may be doubted whether the years of poor harvests could
cause an increase in the number of thefts in Russia. For the agricultural population
is benefited by the high price of grain. <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>However, it is proved by the figures given above that these years have an unfavorable
effect upon criminality, which can be understood if we take into account the fact
that most of the Russian peasants only raise grain for their own consumption, and
that bad crops accordingly affect them seriously.

our discussion it will appear that with time the state of industry, the greater or
less chance to get work, the activity or depression of the general economic life,
have gradually become of far more significance for the increase or decrease of crime,
than a rise or fall in the price of provisions, and that at present these factors

<p>Now, the causes that make crime increase when there is an economic depression are,
according to the author, the following: “The instinct of self-preservation, which
in its harmonious development is the motive for the lawful and moral struggle of men
for existence, and in more restricted form is the principal ground for industrial
activity, in its degeneration … demands a certain, often high, percentage of victims,
who fall into crime, especially theft, fraud, embezzlement, and other offenses against
property. And experience shows that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>greater the care to maintain existence, or often simply to procure daily bread, the
greater is the number of offenses against property. When need appears, at the same
time comes the instinct impelling a man to seize the property of another, better situated
than himself. Infractions of property are in part to be ascribed to other motives.
There is nothing to show, however, that these motives (greed and covetousness, for
example) are stronger in one year and weaker in another throughout a whole people.
We must rather ascribe to them a certain uniformity in their influence upon criminal
activity. The determining factor in the increase and decrease of crimes remains the
general well-being of a people, in earlier times the price of the necessities of life,
at the present the opportunity for employment.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e9433src" href="#xd31e9433">47</a>

<p>A comparison of these figures with those of crime will show that the crimes against
property increase in the years of high prices up to 1855. In 1857 prices fell and
crime decreased.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In the figures for foreign countries we see this relation much less clearly. Dr. Weisz
has indeed succeeded in establishing a similar relation in France, but in Belgium
it is much slighter. In England it is not possible to show that there is any parallelism
between the curves of criminality and of the price of grain. In the years 1831–1840
and 1841–1850 the curve of crime even goes down, while provisions were then very dear.
There must therefore be some other cause, and this is probably that England had a
great industrial development long before any other country.
</p>
<p>After an extremely rapid development up to 1847, manufacturing had to pass through
a formidable crisis. While the average annual number of persons convicted in England
and Wales was 20,455, and this figure fell to 18,100 and 17,400 in the prosperous
years, 1845–1846, it rose during the years of crisis, 1847–1848, to 21,500 and 22,900,
falling again to 21,000 in 1849, when business had resumed its normal course.
</p>
<p>In the years following, industry received an enormous impetus, in consequence of the
discovery of gold in California, the repeal of the Corn Laws, and many other causes.
In 1857 came the panic, which affected all industrial countries, especially England.
In 1856–1860 there was an annual average of 13,565 convictions; in 1857 it was 15,307,
an increase of 12%. That the consequences of this crisis are not to be observed in
the figures for crime in Prussia, is to be attributed to the fact that in that country
manufacturing was little developed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the very dear years 1852–1856 the price of grain remained fairly constant in
Prussia. It was only in 1860–1862 that it rose a little and caused an increase in
the cases of fraud and theft. 1867–1868 were years which were marked by an extraordinarily
high price for grain, which had some influence upon crime, without equalling that
of such years as 1852–1856.
</p>
<p>Crime decreased in the years of war, 1866 and 1870–1871, due as Dr. Müller thinks,
to two facts; first, that a great part of the population capable of committing crimes
were then out of the country; and second, that the feeling of solidarity is stronger
in time of war.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the rise in the price of grain in 1871–1874, crime decreased greatly
after the war of 1870. A modification of the penal law could not be the cause of it;
its origin was deeper. Since 1871 Germany has seen its industries develop prodigiously.
The period of prosperity was of short duration, for in the summer of 1873 came the
crisis, which lasted till 1878. Now it is during these years that the crimes against
property were much increased.
</p>
<p>When we study this period in other countries, in Austria and England, for example,
we see a great industrial development, accompanied by a decrease in crime. The average
number of criminals in Austria for the years 1860–1870 was 32,800, and 26,900 for
the years 1871–1875. In England the figures for the same period were 14,100 and 11,200
respectively. France alone was an exception, for in this country manufacturing did
not begin to develop immediately after the war.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e10548src" href="#xd31e10548">48</a> But in Austria and England the effects of the crisis upon crime were felt just as
in Prussia. In Austria, for example, criminality increased 10%. From 1878 on, business
improved in Prussia and in other countries also, and little by little the number of
crimes against property decreased (between 1885 and 1890 7% in France, 9% in Austria,
and 20% in England).
</p>
<p>In 1889 there was another great disturbance in the economic field, which was prolonged
till 1892. During these years there was a new increase of crime; in Austria, for example,
the average number of convictions was 29,483 in 1890–1894, as against 28,834 for the
five years preceding. In England we see the same phenomenon, and in Prussia as well.
</p>
<p>Dr. Müller calls attention to the marked fall in the price of grain in 1892, and sees
in it a proof that prices have no longer any great <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>influence. Since 1892 there has been a new period of prosperity, and at the same time
a constant diminution of crimes against property.
</p>
<p>Dr. Müller reminds us that preceding moralistic statisticians have brought out the
fact that crimes against persons increase when the price of grain falls, and vice
versa, as is distinctly seen in the tables for the years 1854–1860. But there is a
change during the ten years following. In 1867–1868 the price of grain was high, but
crimes against persons and the public order rose also. Crimes against persons decreased
in the years of war, 1866 and 1870, just as crimes against property did. Since 1871
crimes against persons have in general diminished, principally because of favorable
economic conditions. (The diminution of crimes against morals is chiefly due to a
modification of the law, which prescribed that a case could not be <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>prosecuted except upon complaint. The increase after 1876 was caused by a revocation
of this requirement.) The crimes in question increased anew considerably after the
crisis of 1874. Here is an important exception, then, to the rule that the earlier
statisticians laid down, namely that crimes against persons decrease when economic
conditions grow worse.

<p>“The great economic crisis beginning in 1873 was accompanied by the characteristic
phenomenon that dissatisfaction with the existing economic, social, and political
conditions affected wider circles than heretofore, that this embittered people’s minds,
and brought about sharp oppositions and struggles of the industrial classes against
each other, especially the struggle of labor against capital. The need of an economic
reform was more and more felt, which is to be attained, in the opinion of the powerful,
by force, and in that of the thoughtful, by social legislation. All public life since
the seventies has been dominated by this idea.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11249src" href="#xd31e11249">49</a>
</p>
<p>Here also economic conditions are causes of crime, and show themselves principally
in resistance to officials, etc. The tables show also an increase in the cases of
perjury, bodily injuries, and other crimes that are the consequences of grossness.
The increase is due, according to Dr. Müller, to bad economic conditions. For as a
consequence of these the number of civil cases rose from 60,000 (the average for <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>1871–1873) to 120,000 and 135,000 (1876–1877) and it is by these cases that perjury
becomes possible. It is necessary to attribute to the same causes the great increase
in the number of cases of crimes against personal liberty (also, since 1876, to the
abolition of the requirement of a complaint for prosecution).

<p>“The chief reasons why this crime (against personal liberty), like most crimes against
persons, has constantly increased up to the present, in addition to the growing discontent
with the present economic situation, are two; first, the effect of the spread of great
manufactories in breaking up the family life, with concomitant lack of moral and religious
education, and the too early necessity for self-supporting labor …; and second, the
present inordinate desire for pleasure, whose results are seen not least in the harmful
effects of the immoderate consumption of alcohol; for that this is a prolific source
of the multiplication of crime can hardly be doubted.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11819src" href="#xd31e11819">50</a>
</p>
<p>Dr. Müller’s final conclusion is as follows: “We may regard it as an established truth
that, in the last analysis, the cause for the increase and decrease of crime as a
whole is to be found in the presence or absence of a chance for employment and gain,
in the condition of individual lines of industry, and in the greater or less degree
in which the population as a whole in consequence of this, are in a position to consume.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11824src" href="#xd31e11824">51</a>
</p>
<p>—Recently it has been proved that the conclusion of Dr. Müller with regard to the
slight influence of the price of grain upon criminality was not entirely correct.
Notwithstanding the growing influence of the industrial situation upon criminality,
the price of grain has retained a certain influence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11829src" href="#xd31e11829">52</a>—

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The authors treated of in this chapter, and many others whom I have had to put under
other headings as belonging to some special school, all have this point in common,
that they try to find the causes of crime by means of statistics. The first question
that arises is this: do criminal statistics give a real and complete picture of criminality?
The answer is categorically, No. To give only a few reasons, there are a great many
crimes, naturally insignificant, which remain unknown even to the person injured;
there are others of which justice never takes cognizance, because the injured party
has filed no complaint, either because he has pardoned the offender, or fears the
trouble of a criminal trial, etc.
</p>
<p>In general, not all the cases known to justice are included in the criminal statistics
but only those in which sentence is pronounced. An exception is found in Mayr’s book
(§ VI of this chapter), in which all the crimes known to justice appear. In the first
place the public officer dismisses many cases because of their insignificance (Germany
is an exception—there the officer must prosecute); and in the second place there are
a number of crimes whose authors remain unknown. Finally, only a part of those arraigned
are convicted. Criminal statistics, therefore, cover only a part of the crime that
exists.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12007src" href="#xd31e12007">53</a>
</p>
<p>The enemies of statistics have drawn from the preceding fact the conclusion that criminal
statistics are useless for the study of the etiology of crime. This is an absolutely
false conclusion, as false as <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>it would be to claim that doctors cannot find the cause of a disease, because besides
the thousands of cases known to them, there are at least as many that remain unknown.
The only question that arises is the following: is the number known sufficient? is
there a sufficiently large body of facts in hand for inductive studies? As far as
criminality is concerned the answer can be perfectly positive. The number of offenses
that do not appear in the criminal statistics is certainly large; they are, however,
chiefly insignificant misdemeanors, such as insults, trifling assaults, petty thefts,
etc. These would have little value in determining the etiology of crime, even if the
statistics included them all. Serious crimes, on the other hand, in the majority of
cases, without any doubt appear in the statistics. The great reason why criminal statistics
suffice for etiological investigations is <i>that the ratio of known crime to unknown remains relatively constant</i>. The proofs of this are to be found in the criminal and judicial statistics themselves.
The ratio between cases dismissed and those prosecuted, between convictions and acquittals,
etc., etc., remains practically the same from one year to another. Further, every
statistician of any experience is convinced that the law of averages rules more absolutely
than any despot.
</p>
<p>Finally it must be noted that the fact that there are a number of <i>offenses</i> which do not appear in the criminal statistics, does not mean that there are many
<i>criminals</i> of whom the same can be said. It is the Italian school in particular that has maintained
the proposition that in the struggle between the criminal and society it is the criminal
that has the upper hand. This is a mistake; the criminal generally loses, and in the
great majority of cases very quickly. Certainly the criminals are not punished for
<i>each</i> crime, but the cases in which they <i>remain</i> unpunished are very rare. In the world of criminals itself there is no other opinion
on this point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12031src" href="#xd31e12031">54</a>
</p>
<p>Although the value of statistics in studying the etiology of crime is certain, it
must not be thought that they tell us everything.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12050src" href="#xd31e12050">55</a> I pass over here numerous things which most statistics still lack, for example, a
classification by motive rather than according to the technical distinctions of the
penal laws,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12061src" href="#xd31e12061">56</a>—and will simply call attention to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>difficulty of making international comparisons. The difference merely in the penal
laws makes the comparison very difficult, and in many cases even impossible. Further,
the dissimilarity of procedure, the differences in the organization of the police,
etc., increase this difficulty.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12074src" href="#xd31e12074">57</a> In general, we can say that international comparisons give results where the nature
of the crime (as homicide, for example) minimizes the difference between the codes,
and where the figures show considerable differences. We can truly say that for the
etiology of crime statics are much less important than dynamics. When we apply the
dynamic method to a fairly long period, we have also to allow for the changes that
have taken place in the penal codes and in the police organization, etc.
</p>
<p>The statistical method certainly contains many sources of error. It goes without saying
that this is not a reason for not using it at all, but simply for being careful. We
must guard against conclusions too hastily drawn. If statistics show less criminality
among the Jews—as is generally the case—it is not safe to say, therefore, that the
innate morality of the Jew is greater than that of other men. If crime increases during
a certain period together with irreligion, we have no right to conclude that there
is a causal connection between the two. The connection between the movement of the
price of grain and that of crimes against property has been proved many times, as
we have seen; if this parallelism of the two curves no longer occurs, we cannot say
on that account that economic conditions no longer play a part in the etiology of
these crimes; we have seen that in manufacturing countries the industrial situation
in general dominates the course of economic criminality. Similar examples could easily
be multiplied.
</p>
<p>The statistical method is one of the most effective for discovering the etiology of
crime, and my readers will see that I use it much of the time. Nevertheless, it must
not be forgotten that this method, however important, is only one among several. It
is chiefly valuable in finding the direct causes of crime; as to indirect causes it
gives us much less information. I would call attention to the following example: several
authors have proved that there is an inverse connection between economic conditions
and crimes against persons, <i>i.e.</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>that these crimes increase in times of prosperity (this does not apply to recent times,
however). The conclusion has often been drawn from these facts that an improvement
in the lot of the working-class would lead, as a law of nature, to an increase in
crimes of violence. This is a typical example of the insufficiency of the statistical
method alone. When we seek for the cause of this phenomenon in another way, in the
structure of society, we discover that it is to be found in the low moral and intellectual
condition of the working-classes. There can be no law of nature at the root of the
matter, else the well-to-do classes would be the violent criminals “par excellence.”
It goes without saying that just the contrary is the case.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>To sum up, I conclude that statistics furnish a powerful means of discovering the
causes of crime, provided they are used critically and carefully. The statistical
method is not the only one; to be a good criminologist, it is necessary to be a statistician,
but it is necessary to be a sociologist also.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In “Crime, Its Causes and Remedies”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12199src" href="#xd31e12199">2</a> one of his last works, Professor Lombroso treats, among other things, of the influence
of economic conditions upon criminality.
</p>
<p>Chapter VI, bearing the title, “Subsistence (famine, price of bread)”, is the first
in which we find any observations especially interesting to us. By the aid of data
from von Oettingen, Starke, Corre, and Fornasari di Verce, which we treat separately,
the author calls attention to the fact that the course of criminality is very little
influenced by the price of provisions. He closes by drawing the following conclusion:
</p>
<p>“But, admitting the action of scarcity of food upon the increase of thefts and of
abundance upon the increase of homicides, assaults, and debauchery, it is easy to
understand its slight influence upon the variation of criminality in general, if one
group of crimes increases with a given state of the market, and another group decreases
under the same conditions, and vice versa. Even when the price of food moves in a
constant direction it does not modify essentially the proportion of certain crimes.
For example, in Italy the effect of the rise in price of food upon aggravated thefts
is very marked; yet the greatest difference is between 184 and 105, that is to say,
a variation of 79 to the 100,000. Likewise, when the sexual crimes increase on account
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>of the low price of food, the greatest difference is 2.14 to the 100,000,—a fact easy
to understand when one thinks of the greater influence of heredity, climate, and race.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12209src" href="#xd31e12209">3</a>
</p>
<p>The circumstance that the thefts of food represent hardly 1% of the total cases of
theft (according to Guerry), that in London bread occupies only the 43d place among
43 categories of articles stolen, and that Joly has shown that the cases of theft
of money are much more numerous than those of meal, domestic animals, etc.—all of
this leads the author to the conclusion that the proportion of crimes caused by lack
of food and real misery is not so great as has been supposed.
</p>
<p>—I will not make any criticism of the preceding at this point, but wait until I analyze
the works themselves. The exposition of the work of Dr. G. Mayr, for example, shows
how superficial the observations made by Professor Lombroso are. (See also the analysis
of the work of Dr. Müller, in which it is shown that now the industrial situation
plays a preponderating part in causing crime.) I would only call attention to the
naïve error involved in Professor Lombroso’s last remark, that there are only a few
articles stolen that could immediately provide for pressing needs, and that this proves
that poverty is not an important factor in criminality. If society were not based
upon exchange this might be true, but the assertion has no basis in the present state
of things, when anything may be bought for money. The reason that more money than
food is stolen is to be found, in part, in the facts; first, that money is less bulky,
and consequently can be more easily taken and concealed; and second, that money has
more value than the same quantity of provisions, so that more can be procured with
the same effort. But this proves nothing with regard to the influence of poverty upon
crime.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12215src" href="#xd31e12215">4</a>—
</p>
<p>In the second part of the chapter Professor Lombroso tries to show that the effect
of hunger upon revolts is not very great. He cites a number of cases where there were
no revolts although prices were high and work scarce. Thus, for example, in Strasburg
from 1451 to 1500 and from 1601 to 1625, the price of beef rose 134% and that of pork
92%, and during many years wages fell 10%; and yet there was no insurrection.
</p>
<p>—I must vigorously protest against any such argument, which, in my opinion, has no
value. I will leave out of consideration the last example, which proves but little,
since during these periods the price of bread may have been very low, neutralizing
the effect of low wages <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>(it is quite problematical whether the poorer classes of the population were great
consumers of beef and pork!). But it is inaccurate to conclude from the fact “that
prices were high and there was no insurrection” an absence of influence of the economic
conditions. There may have been a number of factors working in the opposite direction,
which prevented the manifestation of the economic factor. To cite but one example,
it may be that during those times an excessively severe penal law was in force, threatening
the least attempt at insurrection with cruel death.—
</p>
<p>We shall next sum up Chapter IX, “Influence of Economic Conditions—Wealth.” After
saying that it is difficult to estimate the wealth of a country at all accurately,
the author produces the following data in the first section of the chapter. He divides
the provinces of Italy into three groups according to the total wealth (estimated
from taxes on consumption, direct taxes, and taxes on business), and compares the
figures thus gained with some of the principal kinds of crimes, reaching the following
results:

<p>Professor Lombroso draws the conclusion, “that fraudulent crimes increase positively
with the increase of wealth, and the same is true of thefts, but if we add rural thefts
we get the maximum where wealth is least; and this last is always true of homicides.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12323src" href="#xd31e12323">6</a>
</p>
<p>“The results for sexual crimes are more unexpected. They show their minimum in Italy
where wealth is moderate, and their maximum where there is the minimum of wealth.
Italy thus presents an exception, as the usual course of sexual crimes is to increase
with the increase of wealth.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12329src" href="#xd31e12329">7</a>
</p>
<p>Another way of estimating the wealth of a country is by means of the inheritance tax.
For different Italian provinces the following results are thus obtained:

<p>This table gives very little information as to the influence of wealth upon criminality,
since we can draw from it the most contradictory conclusions. Note, for example, that
the highest figures for theft are to be found in the regions of Latium and Sardinia,
<i>i.e.</i> in the richest and the poorest provinces, etc., etc.
</p>
<p>—I have more than once had occasion to show that the value of such researches is fictitious.
It is not the total amount of wealth but its distribution that bears upon criminality.

tells us that in Massachusetts of every 220 persons convicted, 147 are without regular
work, and that 68% of criminals have no occupation. According to Professor Lombroso
this is easily explained by the fact that criminals do not like to work. According
to Bosco there were only 18% of murderers in the United States without work (—the
proportion not being given for non-criminals, these figures have little value—). Finally,
Professor Lombroso mentions the opinion of Coghlan, who says that unemployment has
no influence upon criminality in New South Wales (—upon what he bases his opinion,
we do not know—).
</p>
<p>—Such data as these (to a subject of such high importance as this the author gives
but thirty lines) suffice for the conclusion that the phenomenon in question has little
significance for criminality. I have only to recall the extensive studies of Mayr,
Denis, Müller, <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>Lafargue, and others, upon this subject, to prove the inaccuracy of this idea.—

<p>In the table on the preceding page the figures for criminality of different countries
are compared with the number of days’ wages equivalent to the annual cost of food
for one individual. These figures give us a composite picture of the price of food
and the wage-scale.
</p>
<p>This table shows; first, that excessive labor with a low wage, <i>i.e.</i> with a lack of proper nutrition, has a certain correspondence with homicide; second,
there is also a certain correspondence with assaults (Spain and Belgium furnishing
exceptions); third, sexual crimes are most common where we find the fewest days’ work
and vice versa (Great Britain and some other countries being exceptions); fourth,
that theft shows no correspondence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12852src" href="#xd31e12852">8</a>

<p>There are several exceptions to this rule; for example, the richest, like Palermo,
Rome, Naples, and Leghorn, give very high figures for homicides. According to Professor
Lombroso the explanation in the case of Palermo and Naples is to be found in the geographical
situation; in the case of Palermo, in race and the abuse of alcohol; and in the case
of Rome, in race, the abuse of alcohol, and in the political situation.

<p>Here is just the opposite of what we get in Italy. The author explains this in the
following manner: first, the richest districts are those that are industrial, where
the influx of immigrants is greatest (these latter committing four times as many crimes
as the French); second, because of ethnic and climatic factors; third, because of
the greater wealth of France, which is four times as rich as Italy; and fourth, because
of the demoralizing influence of quickly acquired wealth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13102src" href="#xd31e13102">9</a>
</p>
<p>The industrial activity of a country causes a considerable increase of criminality,
especially when it displaces agriculture. Of 42 agricultural departments only 11,
or 26%, go beyond the average number of assassinations in France; while the average
is exceeded by <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>10 out of the 26 departments of mixed industry, or 38%, and by 7 out of 17 manufacturing

<p>Not only poverty, but often wealth as well may cause crime. This is why some very
wealthy districts show a figure for criminality as high as do the very poor. “The
cause of all this is only too clear. On the one side poverty and the lack of absolute
necessities impel toward the theft of indispensable things for the satisfaction of
the individuals’ own needs. This is the first cord binding poverty and assaults upon
property. On the other hand, poverty makes men impulsive through the cortical irritation
following the abuse of wine and alcohol, that terrible poison to which so many of
the poor resort to still the pangs of hunger. Account must be taken also of the degeneration
produced by scurvy, scrofula, anemia, and alcoholism in the parents, which often transforms
itself into epilepsy and moral insanity. Poverty also drives men to commit brutal
eliminations of individuals who are an unwelcome burden upon the family, … Poverty
is indirectly a cause of sexual crimes, on account of the difficulty which the poor
have of obtaining satisfaction through prostitution; on account of precocious promiscuity
in factories and mines; etc., … On the other hand, when a slight temptation toward
evil is presented to an individual in comfortable circumstances, he is rendered physically
and morally stronger by sufficient nutrition and a sounder moral training, and is
less pressed by need, so that while he feels the impulsion to do evil, he can more
easily resist it.
</p>
<p>“But wealth, in its turn, is a source of degeneration from other causes, such as syphilis,
exhaustion, etc. It drives men to crime through vanity, in order to surpass others,
and from a fatal ambition to cut a figure in the world.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13159src" href="#xd31e13159">11</a> It may be asked why it happens then that the inmates of prisons are almost always
poor and rarely rich. The answer, according to the author, is that because of the
influence <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>of his fortune, family, etc., the rich man can more easily extricate himself from
the clutches of the law than the poor man, who knows no one, cannot employ a famous
lawyer, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>Professor Lombroso sums up his opinion as follows: “The economic factor has a great
influence upon crime, not, however, that poverty is the principal cause of it, for
excessive wealth, or money too quickly acquired, plays a large part as well; and poverty
and wealth are frequently neutralized by the effect of race and climate.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13166src" href="#xd31e13166">12</a>

<h3 class="label">II.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">R. Garofalo.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Chapter III of his “<span lang="fr">Criminologie</span>”, and more especially in the first part, bearing the title “<span lang="fr">la Misère</span>”, this author treats of the influence of economic conditions upon criminality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13183src" href="#xd31e13183">13</a> The question which must be answered with regard to this subject, according to Garofalo,
is the following: “Whether the so-called ‘economic iniquity’, a condition by which
all citizens are either proprietors or proletarians, is the chief cause or, at least,
one of the most important causes, of criminality.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13207src" href="#xd31e13207">14</a>
</p>
<p>It may be that a workman, <i>i.e.</i> a person who can only provide for his own needs and those of his family by selling
his labor, can find no work, and for that reason falls into theft; but the author
is of the opinion that in our days this almost never happens (leaving aside periods
of crisis), and that if it happens the worker will generally find some one ready to
help him, and that crime is therefore not a necessity. There is, indeed, absolute
poverty, but it is almost always the result of a lack of courage and energy, and not
due to a lack of work. It is not hunger, but a desire to procure the same pleasures
as those enjoyed by the favored of fortune, that impels the working-man to commit
crime. But this is not only the case with the working class but with other classes
as well. For this desire belongs to every man; the millionaire envies the multimillionaire,
etc. In order that this desire should lead to crime, it is not necessary that there
should be a particular economic situation, but only a particular psychic condition<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>—the individual must have his sense of honesty weakened or wanting. Desire will cease
to lead to crime only when there is no longer any advantage to be gained by it, and
since this is inconceivable, crime will always exist. This explains why the number
of crimes committed by the proletariat is very great, but at the same time why the
cases of forgery, bankruptcy, etc. are very numerous among the other classes. In 1880
the figure for crimes against property (and analogous crimes) committed in Italy by
proletarians, compared with those committed by property-owners, was as 88 to 12, while
the ratio of the number of proletarians to that of property-owners was as 90 to 10.
These proportions are nearly the same, which proves that as regards these crimes the
proletarian class is no more criminal than the others.
</p>
<p>Some authors are of the opinion that crimes against persons are equally caused in
large measure by bad economic conditions, since bad education, lack of discretion,
etc. are consequences of these conditions. In Garofalo’s opinion this idea is inaccurate,
since the bad conditions in which the proletariat live lead indeed to roughness, <i>i.e.</i> make them insensible to the suffering of others, but it does not follow that the
proletarians are totally deprived of moral sentiments. The criminal statistics of
Italy show that 16% of the correctional criminality was committed by property-owners,
though they form but 10% to 11% of the population. Garofalo attempts to prove the
truth of his thesis also by a classification of criminals by trades. The agricultural
class in Italy, the poorest and most ignorant, form 25.39% of those brought before
the correctional tribunals, while those engaged in manufacturing, commerce, the army,
etc., those with some education, therefore, who are much less numerous in the population,
form 13.58%. In 1881 the Italian population included 67.25% of illiterates, and in
1880 68.09% of those correctionally convicted were illiterate. Further it has been
proved many times that an improvement in economic conditions is accompanied by an
increase of crime. In France, for example, wages have risen, the consumption of cereals,
like that of meat, has increased, and the number of children enjoying the advantages
of a primary education is more extensive and yet criminality has grown greatly in
the same period. To the possible objection “that many authors, like Mayr, have proved
that the rise in the price of grain is accompanied by an increase of crimes against
property, and vice versa, and that economic conditions are consequently an important
cause of crime”, Garofalo responds that crimes against persons increase with the fall
in the price of grain, and that consequently, by the changes in the economic life
there has been <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>brought about a change in the kind, but not in the extent, of criminality. Exceptional
occurrences, such as famines, commercial crises, etc., increase crime only in appearance.
If the question is probed to the bottom (the author appears not to have done so himself,
at least he does not record any results) it is probable that it will be discovered
that what happens is only that the form of crime becomes more serious, that the vagrant,
for example, becomes a highway-man, etc.
</p>
<p>The conclusions that the author draws are the following:
</p>
<p>“First. The present economic order, that is to say, the distribution of wealth as
it exists today, is not a cause of criminality in general.
</p>
<p>“Second. The fluctuations which are wont to occur in the economic order may bring
about an increase in one form of criminality, but this increase is compensated for
by the diminution of another form. These fluctuations are, therefore, possible causes
of specific <i>criminality</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13228src" href="#xd31e13228">15</a>
</p>
<p>—My criticism of what has gone before will be limited to some principal points only.
</p>
<p>First. The author dodges the question when he includes under economic conditions poverty
only, and this in the very limited sense of the lack of the absolute necessities.
He who writes upon the connection between crime and economic conditions must analyze
the whole present economic system, and not stop with one of the consequences of that
system, the poverty in which the proletarians find themselves. Consequently Garofalo’s
whole argument, tending to show that the bourgeoisie have a great part in the crimes
against property, is beside the mark, for capitalism results in great uncertainty
of existence for the bourgeoisie also. It is then quite comprehensible that this class
should be guilty of crimes of this kind. According to Fornasari di Verce, however,
the Italian statistics show that the well-to-do class take less part in crime than
the poor<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> According to him 13% of all those convicted in 1887 were well-to-do, a class which,
roughly speaking, forms 40% of the whole population. (See also Colajanni, “<span lang="it">La Sociologia Criminale</span>”, II, pp. 536<span></span> <i>ff.</i>)
</p>
<p>In consequence of this arbitrary restriction of the subject the author’s remarks are
of little value. But aside from this there are still serious charges to be made against
his manner of treating the subject.
</p>
<p>Second. The assertion of Garofalo that in general in our present society he who wishes
to work can find work, is not worth combating in a serious book. To say that machinery
does not every day make <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>some workers unnecessary, that there are no industrial crises causing an enormous
amount of involuntary unemployment, is conclusive proof that one does not know the
present mode of production. The existence of a group of the population, the so-called
lower proletariat (“<span lang="fr"><span class="corr" id="xd31e13250" title="Source: bas-proletariat">bas-prolétariat</span></span>”, “<span lang="de">Lumpen-proletariat</span>”) cannot be a natural phenomenon, since it has not been always and everywhere present;
it is strictly bound up with certain modes of production.
</p>
<p>Third. As I have had occasion to show already in more than one place, the increase
of crimes against persons during periods of prosperity has a very great, though indirect,
connection with economic conditions.
</p>
<p>Fourth. That poverty in the strict sense of the word is not the sole cause of economic
criminality, that cupidity plays also an important rôle, I do not wish to deny. Only,
this cupidity is not an innate quality of man, present everywhere and always, but
is awakened only under certain economic conditions. This is especially the case in
our present society.
</p>
<p>Fifth. According to the author there are certain circumstances which may lead to the
commission of a crime, but the true cause of crime is to be found in the absence or
weakness of the instinct of honesty. That there exists such an “instinct of honesty”
is one of numerous assertions made by Garofalo for which he produces no proof, and,
in accordance with the general opinion of sociologists, I class it among the most
profound errors. A moral disposition is innate in man, and varies greatly with individuals,
but moral concepts—for example, that it is forbidden to steal—are certainly not innate.
The very way in which Garofalo puts the question is wrong; we must not set the circumstances
that have influenced a man at a certain moment over against an innate quality of honesty
(fictitious besides) but must examine all the conditions which have influenced his
innate moral disposition through the whole of his life, as well as his environment
at a given moment.
</p>
<p>To say that the influence of environment cannot be great, because persons well brought
up sometimes commit crimes, is very superficial. Upon this point there is something
deeper and more important to be said.—

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In order to present Professor Ferri’s views, I shall analyze “<span lang="it">Socialismo e criminalità</span>” and a passage connected with our subject, taken <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>from “<span lang="it">Sociologia <span class="corr" id="xd31e13275" title="Source: criminelle">criminale</span></span>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13278src" href="#xd31e13278">16</a> This analysis will be more detailed than that of most of the other authors, since
in reality the opinion of Professor Ferri is the synthesis of the opinions of many
other authorities. For this reason and others it is of the highest importance.
</p>
<p>“<span lang="it">Socialismo e criminalità</span>” is a polemic work directed in part against “<span lang="it">Il delitto e la questione sociale</span>” of Turati, and in part as Professor Ferri himself says in “<span lang="it">Socialismo e scienza positiva</span>”, against socialism as far as that involves the revolutionary method and the concomitant
“nebulous romanticism.”
</p>
<p>In his “Preliminari” the author gives some definitions of socialism; combats socialism
of every kind, declares it to be unscientific, and sets in opposition to it sociology,
which is entirely scientific.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13297src" href="#xd31e13297">17</a> We pass over this part of the work in silence, since it has little importance for
our subject, and turn our attention to the end of the “Preliminari”, where the author
gives an exposition of the ideas which the socialists, according to him, have about
crime:
</p>
<p>“I. The origin of the phenomenon of crime is to be found in society as at present
constituted.
</p>
<p>“II. More especially, the economic disorder of the population caused by the unjust
inequality of individuals and classes, is the cause of every other disorder, moral
or intellectual, and therefore of crime also.
</p>
<p>“III. When the social transformation or revolution which the socialists desire has
taken place, the social atmosphere will be most favorable.
</p>
<p>“IV. In the socialistic order the individual also will be much superior to the man
corrupted or demoralized by present conditions.
</p>
<p>“V. And then crime, like poverty, ignorance, prostitution, and immorality in general,
will have ended its unhappy tyranny over the human race.”
</p>
<p>—It is not certain that an adherent of scientific socialism would agree that these
theses are entirely accurate; for example, the second, that the bad economic condition
of the population is the cause of crime—for the expression “economic condition” has
here too limited a meaning, namely that of poverty, misery, etc. In place of this
he <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>would rather make use of the expression, “mode of production.” It is this which, in
the last analysis, rules the whole social life, according to the Marxists.—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The first chapter of Professor Ferri’s work, bearing the title of “<span lang="it">la genesi sociale e individuale del delitto</span>”, begins by remarking that the socialists blame society as the cause of all evils,
including poverty and crime. On the one hand, they do this because of their “strategy
of propaganda”, on the other hand it is a reaction against the extreme individualism
which sprang from the French Revolution. They generally pay no attention to individual
factors, or perhaps recognize them in part, but attribute their origin to society
also. Between these two extremes is to be found criminal sociology, which says that
the causes of crime are manifold.
</p>
<p>According to the author there are three groups of the factors of crime: the <i>anthropological</i> or <i>individual</i> factors, the <i>cosmic</i> or <i>physical</i> factors, and the <i>social</i> factors. Since many authors, wholly or partially, share this view, which constitutes
an attack against the very foundation of the idea of the social origin of crime, we
will examine it here fully.
</p>
<p>We take from “<span lang="fr">Sociologie criminelle</span>”, where this doctrine is best set forth, the following statement of it. “Every crime
is the resultant of individual, physical, and social conditions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13334src" href="#xd31e13334">18</a> The individual factor is, according to the author, the most important, the primordial
factor, so to speak, for he says: “The social environment gives form to the crime;
but this has its origin in an anti-social biological constitution (organic or psychic).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13340src" href="#xd31e13340">19</a> The factors pointed out are the following:
</p>
<p>“The anthropological factors, inherent in the person of the criminal, are the first
condition of crime, and divide themselves into three subclasses, according as the
person of the criminal is looked at from an organic, psychic, or social point of view.
</p>
<p>“<i>The organic constitution of the criminal</i> constitutes the first subclass of anthropological factors and includes all the anomalies
of the skull, brain, viscera, sensibility, reflex activity, and all bodily characteristics
in general, such as physiognomy, tattooing, etc.
</p>
<p>“<i>The psychical constitution of the criminal</i> includes anomalies of intelligence and feeling, especially of the moral sense and
the peculiarities of the criminal dialect and literature.
</p>
<p>“<i>The personal characteristics of the criminal</i> include the purely <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>biological features of his condition, such as race, age, sex; and the bio-social features,
such as civil status, profession, residence, social class, and education, which have
been up to this time the almost exclusive subject of criminal statistics.
</p>
<p>“<i>The physical factors of crime</i> are the climate, nature of the soil, length of nights and days, the seasons, the
annual temperature, meteorological conditions, and agricultural production.
</p>
<p>“<i>The social factors</i> include the density of population; public opinion, morals, religion; condition of
the family; the educational system; industrial production; alcoholism; economic and
political conditions; public administration, the courts, the police; and in general
the legislative, civil, and penal organization:—that is to say, a medley of latent
causes, which interlace and combine in all parts of the social organism, and almost
always escape the attention of … criminologists and legislators.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13366src" href="#xd31e13366">20</a>
</p>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">ANTHROPOLOGICAL FACTORS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us consider first the “personal characteristics of the criminal.” Professor Ferri
draws the following conclusions with regard to the existence of anthropological factors
in general: “In fact, if crime were the product of the social environment exclusively,
how could the fact be explained, that in the same social environment and in like circumstances
of poverty, abandonment, and lack of education, out of 100 individuals, 60 commit
no crime, and of the 40 that remain, 5 prefer suicide to crime, 5 become insane, 5
become beggars or non-dangerous vagrants, and only the 25 others become real criminals?
And why is it that among these, while some limit themselves to theft without violence,
others commit robberies, and even, before the victim resists, or threatens, or calls
for help, commit a murder with the sole aim of theft?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13373src" href="#xd31e13373">21</a>
</p>
<p>—It seems to me that there are many objections to be made to this rather carelessly
drawn conclusion. In the first place, Professor Ferri is of the opinion that it may
be assumed that it will be easy to find groups of persons only a quarter of whom become
criminal, though they all live in the same bad environment. Leaving out of account
the individuals who, because of their physical condition are incapable of crime, I
do not believe that there are, for example, 60% who have never been convicted. However,
even admitting that this assertion is accurate, then, that out of 100 persons living
in the same environment, only one part will fall into crime, I believe that it <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>is impossible to find even <i>two</i> persons who live, and have lived, in an environment <i>exactly</i> similar, and whose parents also have always lived in the same surroundings. In this
way only can the question be clearly put. It is not only present conditions that influence
a man; all past conditions have their part in the motives of present acts. It cannot
be denied that the present includes the past. Nor ought the conditions which have
influenced the parents to be excluded. Let us put the following case: A, B, and C
live in the same very bad surroundings. A commits suicide, B becomes crazy, C commits
a crime. The parents of A were well-to-do, gave their child a good education, and
accustomed him to consider many things as necessities. Fallen into poverty, then weakened
and become incapable of good work, A believes that it is impossible for him to restore
himself. His moral ideas, acquired in his youth, are opposed to his engaging in crime.
And then the few francs that he would be able to steal would not be sufficient to
maintain him in the life to which he has been accustomed. Consequently he commits
suicide. B is the child of a father who became an alcoholic from actual poverty. Inferior
on this account, B cannot keep up the struggle for existence and becomes insane. The
parents of C were indigent. He received no education; moral ideas are totally unknown
to him; he has never lived in anything but poverty, and commits a theft when the opportunity
presents itself without any hesitation. In these three cases, which occur daily, circumstances
are the only factor that enters into consideration.
</p>
<p>I have said above that there are no two persons who live in <i>exactly</i> the same circumstances. This word “exactly” is not used by Professor Ferri, and in
this, in my opinion, he is wrong. In ordinary life we speak of great and small causes.
But in treating of scientific questions this is surely forbidden. For no one is ignorant
that what is apparently the least important occurrence may have the most extensive
consequences.
</p>
<p>May I here be permitted to make a quotation from an interesting page of Professor
Manouvrier upon this question: “That the effect of environment is generally understood
in too limited a way, we see proved every day in the appreciation expressed, of the
causes that have determined certain differences of productive power or moral conduct.
It is a question, perhaps, of two brothers. It is said that they have been brought
up <i>exactly</i> in the same manner, that they have received exactly the same education, and that
the question of environment is thus settled. Immediately the doctors begin to call
in <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>atavism, to feel the bumps of the head, to study facial asymmetry, etc. Anatomy must
be appealed to, since the influence of environment has been eliminated. It can be
put down to bad luck if some bump, some depression, some asymmetry is not found that
will serve, whether or no, to account for a solution of the question. There remains
always, further, the resource of invoking invisible, hypothetical vices of the internal
constitution. The phrenologists were in a relatively difficult situation; they had
to find a fixed anatomical character, a bump for a function specified in advance,
or they were obliged to imagine a conflict of bump with bump. The present method is
less exacting; it is enough to find no matter what deviation from morphological perfection,
without its being necessary to show the connection between this deviation and the
physiological inferiority to be explained. But what am I saying? The question is often
of an inferiority of a sociological order, and trouble is not even taken to make sure,
to begin with, that this corresponds to a psychological inferiority. Yet however indispensable
this may be as a preliminary, it is not enough; it must be ascertained that this inferiority
implies a functional trouble before calling in pathological anatomy at all hazards.
</p>
<p>“The statement is made that the two brothers have been subjected to the same environmental
influences merely because they have been brought up in the same house, taught in the
same school, fed and clothed alike. Yet the mere fact of having been born first or
second is not without importance. To have been reared with an older or with a younger
brother constitutes a difference of environment that may contribute powerfully to
differentiate character. Add to this the differences of environment proceeding from
nurses, servants, diseases, games, etc., and you will have opened headings under which
may be classed differences innumerable. There are no small things in such a matter.
Biographies as now written are no more than outlines when one thinks of what truly
psychological biographies ought to be. To have been taught in the same college in
the case of two brothers is a similarity that may, and certainly does, conceal the
greatest differences. They have not had the same teachers, the same fellow-pupils,
nor, above all, the same comrades. Between the education given, and that actually
received, the difference may be great.…
</p>
<p>“The influences that act upon the child outside of the curriculum have the more chance
to be effective, since the curriculum is carried out in the less agreeable manner.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13400src" href="#xd31e13400">22</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>In consequence of what has been said, I believe that the conclusion of Professor Ferri
that there are anthropological factors of crime, is too hasty. But there are still
other objections to be urged to it.
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that two persons who live, and have lived, in the same circumstances
are in a position to commit a very advantageous crime, and their morality does not
prevent. At the moment when the time comes to act, one commits the crime and the other
does not—he lacks the courage. Courage, then, is a factor of crime, and the lack of
it a factor of virtue! <i>Not so, that depends upon circumstances.</i> In another case, he who commits a crime is stupid, and does not consider the risk,
and he who does not commit it is a crafty man. Stupidity, then, is a factor of crime,
and craft of virtue! <i>Not so, that depends upon circumstances.</i> The reverse is also true, probably more true still. Thousands of great criminals
so far from being stupid have had something of the genius in them.
</p>
<p>The famous individual factors are only ordinary human qualities, like courage, strength,
needs, intelligence, etc. etc.,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13416src" href="#xd31e13416">23</a> which men possess in differing degrees, and which in like circumstances lead the
one rather than the other to commit a crime. <i>These qualities in themselves, however, have nothing to do with crime.</i> Professor Manouvrier expresses my thought on this subject in the following: “There
are, however, certain individuals more moved to crime than others, in circumstances
otherwise equal. Certainly, as man is more given to crime than woman, as a robust
and bold man is more given to crimes of violence than one who is miserable and timid,
etc., yet each type of character finds some kind of crime practicable, if only arson.
The athlete will be more inclined to strike, the smooth talker to play the confidence
man, but we do not for that reason indict muscular strength, nor ready speech, nor
boldness, nor agility, nor address. No more do we indict violence or trickery, qualities
defined from the vicious use made of qualities valuable for honest purposes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13421src" href="#xd31e13421">24</a>
</p>
<p>The reasoning of Professor Ferri, that there is in every crime, besides others, an
anthropological factor, is only the statement of the fact, known long before the rise
of modern criminology, that the predisposition to crime is not the same with all men.
This predisposition, as we have seen, considered by itself, has nothing to do with
crime as such. So much the more is the conclusion of Professor Ferri and the Italian
school in general absolutely false, when they deduce from the undeniable fact that
the predisposition is not the <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>same for all, the notion that this predisposition is by nature pathological.
</p>
<p>Thus we have finally come to two other groups of anthropological factors: <i>the organic constitution of the criminal</i>, as, for example, the anomalies of the skull, brain, etc. and <i>the psychical constitution of the criminal</i>, as, for example, the anomalies of intelligence and feeling.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13438src" href="#xd31e13438">25</a> This is the special territory of the Italian school: the criminal is a being apart—“<span lang="la">genus homo criminalis</span>”—with special stigmata peculiar to him; there is a criminal type, anatomically recognizable;
most criminals are born-criminals, etc. The explanation of this special character
is to be found in atavism, an hypothesis later replaced by that of epilepsy; finally
it has been claimed that the character of the criminal is in general of a pathological
nature.
</p>
<p>In our purely sociological work, though it combats in an indirect way the hypothesis
of the Italian school, we do not have to concern ourselves with the conflict between
the different anthropological schools, with regard to the origin of crime. We demonstrate
merely, what no one who judges fairly will attempt to deny, that the hypothesis of
the Italian school is erroneous. The anthropological authorities like Manouvrier,
Baer, <span class="corr" id="xd31e13446" title="Source: Naecke">Näcke</span>, and others, have broken this doctrine down.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13449src" href="#xd31e13449">26</a> There are no stigmata belonging to criminals only, nor is there any criminal type;
the atavistic hypothesis is one of the profoundest errors.
</p>
<p>Although the doctrine of Lombroso and his school is in general abandoned by anthropologists,
it still persists in the acceptance of one fact, to which it is its immortal merit
to have called attention, namely that there are a number of criminals (though a very
limited number) who show a truly pathological nature, and whose criminal character
can only be explained by this pathological nature. For example, when someone in an
epileptic condition commits a murder, without any motive; or the case in which a well-to-do
individual steals continually useless articles, of little value, etc., etc. Even in
most of these instances, which are a small minority in the colossal mass of criminality,
the social environment plays its part; but it must be recognized without reserve that
here we have to do with true individual factors, peculiar to certain individuals.
The hypothesis of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>Italian school is, then, accurate for the exception, but false as a rule.—

<h4 class="main">PHYSICAL FACTORS<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is evident that the nature of the soil, the climate, the physical environment in
a word, must have an important influence upon the mode of production, and consequently
upon society.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13470src" href="#xd31e13470">27</a>
</p>
<p>It is easily understood why those who inhabit the regions of Siberia covered with
snow have not become agriculturists; and why Holland, without mines of iron and coal
has not become a great manufacturing country, but instead, situated upon the sea and
traversed by great rivers, has become commercial. But these physical factors have
remained constant or nearly constant during historical periods, while the organization
of society has undergone changes that have great effects. We cannot explain these
changes by a constant factor.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e13475" title="Source: Plechenow">Plechanow</span> formulates this very well in his “<span lang="de">Beiträge der Geschichte des Materialismus</span>.” He says: “The character of man’s natural environment determines the character of
his productive activity, of his means of production. The means of production, however,
determines the reciprocal relationships of men in the process of production as inevitably
as the equipment of an army determines its entire organization, and all the relationships
of the individuals of which it is made up. Now the reciprocal relations of men in
the social process of production determine the entire structure of society. The influence
of the natural environment upon this structure is therefore incontestable. <i>The character of the natural environment determines that of the social environment.</i> For example: ‘The necessity of computing the time of the rising of the Nile, created
Egyptian astronomy and with it the domination of the priestly caste as guides in agriculture.’
</p>
<p>“But this is only one side of the matter. Another side must also be considered if
one is not to draw entirely false conclusions. The circumstances of production are
the <i>result</i>, the productive forces are the cause. But the effect becomes a cause in its turn;
the circumstances of production become a new source of the development of the productive
forces. This leads to a double result.
</p>
<p>“1. The mutual influence of the circumstances of production and the productive forces
causes a social movement, which has its own logic and a law of its own, independent
of the natural environment. <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>For example: Private property in the primitive phase of its development is always
the fruit of the labor of the property-holder himself, as may be very well observed
in the Russian villages. There necessarily comes a time, however, when it becomes
the reverse of what it was before: it supposes the work of another, and becomes capitalistic
private property, as we can likewise see any day in the Russian villages. This phenomenon
is the effect of the immanent law of the evolution of private property. All that the
natural environment can accomplish in this case consists in accelerating this movement
through favoring the development of the productive forces.
</p>
<p>“2. Since the social evolution has its own logic, independent of any direct influence
from the natural environment, it may happen that a people, though inhabiting the same
land and retaining almost the same physical peculiarities, may have at different epochs
of its history social and political institutions which are very little similar, or
even totally different one from another.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13493src" href="#xd31e13493">28</a>
</p>
<p>Crime being a social phenomenon, and society being influenced, as we have seen, by
the physical environment, one might say that this environment is a factor in criminality.
He who reasons thus would have to grant that the physical environment is only an indirect
factor, and therefore a very remote cause. It would be as fair to say that the invention
of gunpowder was one of the causes of all murders committed with fire-arms. However,
in reasoning thus I believe we forget that crime is an <i>historic</i> phenomenon, modifying itself according to the condition of society, and consequently
regulated by laws that are independent of the physical environment. In other words,
the environment is the reason why a people provides for its needs by working the material
that nature has furnished; but the manner in which this work is done is independent
of this environment. And it is upon this manner of working that criminality depends.
An example taken from practice will make clear what I have been saying.
</p>
<p>From the nature of the soil of Sicily it is possible to work sulphur mines there.
The criminality of Sicily is very great, especially in the parts where the mines are
found, and many murders particularly are committed there. We might be disposed to
believe that here the physical factors came into play. Now it is true that the nature
of the soil is the cause of the exploiting of the mines, but the criminality is dependent
entirely upon the way in which the exploiting is done, and this has nothing to do
with the physical environment. To particularize: these mines are exploited in the
capitalistic fashion, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>with the aim of getting as much profit as possible, which brings it about that the
workers are untaught, demoralized and made degenerate by ill-paid labor, excessively
severe, and carried on in an unwholesome atmosphere. Hence come the higher figures
for criminality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13506src" href="#xd31e13506">29</a>
</p>
<p>Most authors who have concerned themselves with the influence of these physical factors,
have only observed their direct influence upon man. Many of them have paid no attention
to the importance that these factors may have for the character of society, and they
have taken no account of the fact that society develops according to laws independent
of the physical environment. Phenomena have been ascribed to the direct influence
of the physical environment, which have no such relationship. It is a fact pretty
generally recognized, for example, that the number of violent crimes is greater in
the South than in the North. The cause frequently given is the obvious one that it
is the difference of climate. But this overlooks the fact that the phase of social
development reached in the southern countries is totally different from that in the
northern countries, and this difference explains that of the criminality against persons.
Upon this subject Professor Tarde says: “Statistics compiled in epochs when, civilization
not having passed from the South to the North, the North was more barbarous, would
certainly have shown that crimes of blood were more numerous in the northern climates,
where now they are more rare, and would have induced the Quetelets of that day to
formulate a law precisely the reverse of the one now stated. For example, if we divide
Italy into three zones, Lombardy, Central, and Southern Italy, we shall find that
at present there are in the first 3 homicides to the 100,000 inhabitants annually,
in the second nearly 10, and in the third more than 16. But shall we estimate that
in the palmy days of Grecia Major, when Crotona and Sybaris flourished in the south
of a peninsula which, in the North, was totally peopled with brigands and barbarians,
except for the Etruscans, the proportion of bloody crimes would not have been reversed?
At present there are in Italy, in proportion to the population, sixteen times as many
homicides as in England, nine times as many as in Belgium, and five times as many
as in France. But we could swear that under the Roman Empire it was quite otherwise,
and that the savage Britons, and even the Belgians and the Gauls surpassed the effeminate
Romans in habitual ferocity of manners, in vindictive fury and bravery. <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>According to Maine the Scandinavian literature shows that homicide during the period
of barbarism was a ‘daily accident’ with these peoples of the North, at present the
mildest and most inoffensive in Europe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13530src" href="#xd31e13530">30</a>
</p>
<p>It is plain from what has gone before that I have not wished to deny the <i>direct</i> influence of the physical environment upon man. Indeed, it is a fact which the whole
world has observed. According to many persons, then—and a number of scientific researches
have proved it—a high degree of criminality against persons proceeds from a hot temperature,
while a low temperature, on the other hand, leads to many crimes against property.
This implies not only that the kind of crime is different in hot countries from that
in cold, but also that the change of the seasons with their variations in temperature
have the corresponding effects.
</p>
<p>I will not fatigue the reader by citing an unlimited number of examples to prove that
the exceptions to this rule are very numerous. We cannot find a greater number of
crimes against persons and a smaller number of crimes against property with each degree
nearer the equator. If this were the case dishonesty would be unknown at the equator,
and everyone there would be very violent. There are countries which, though in the
same latitude, are very different as to crime, as there are others, much alike as
to crime though situated far from each other, etc., etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13543src" href="#xd31e13543">31</a> The adherents of the theory of the “physical environment” explain these exceptions
by saying that they are caused by the “social environment.” By so doing they recognize
that the latter may entirely alter and even annihilate the influence of the former.
Let us concern ourselves rather with the different kinds of crime, and investigate
the influence which the physical environment exercises upon it.
</p>
<p>In the first place, as to the assertion that cold increases the number of crimes against
property it is unnecessary to speak at length, for nearly all authors are agreed that
not physical but economic causes come into play here. Cold increases men’s needs;
they must have warmer clothing and a well heated dwelling. But it is clear that all
this is no motive for stealing. For the person of means gets what he wants with his
own money. It is the present social organization that, <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>during the severe weather, does not permit people to provide for the needs that are
more numerous then, for the opportunity to work is more often lacking in winter than
in summer.
</p>
<p>As to crimes against persons Professor Ferri is of the opinion that the direct influence
of temperature is as follows: “The increase of acts of violence to persons, which
is observed in connection with higher temperatures, must be chiefly dependent upon
the direct physiological effect of heat upon the human organism. For by the greater
warmth the consumption of material for the production of animal heat is cut down,
and hence a surplus of force is stored up capable of being used for other purposes.
But this, in union with the heightened irritability of temper, may easily degenerate
into that criminal activity which shows itself in acts of violence to persons. With
this psychological effect of the heat, it is true, there is coupled, in the case of
the poorer classes who form the majority of the population, the effect of more easily
obtained and more plentiful food, but this social cause in this connection is of less
importance than the direct biological influence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13578src" href="#xd31e13578">32</a>
</p>
<p>The first explanation of Professor Ferri is astonishing because everyone feels that
the heat has a different effect upon himself than the one given. The fact that during
hot weather the consumption of bodily fuel is not so great as in cold weather cannot
be considered as the most important point in treating of the question of crime. Heat
enervates men, weakens their organism, and is the cause of men’s doing as little as
possible. It has, then, just the opposite effect to that ascribed to it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13589src" href="#xd31e13589">33</a>
</p>
<p>More than once I have had occasion to point out that it is unjust to say that the
improved food of the poorer classes in summer can be the cause of the greater criminality
during that season. If this were the case the persons who are well nourished at all
times would furnish the greatest number of violent criminals. Now we know that just
the contrary is the case. In my opinion the explanation is to be sought in the fact
that in summer people come into contact with one another more, and consequently there
is more opportunity for evil doing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13600src" href="#xd31e13600">34</a> But this in itself cannot naturally explain the increase of crimes. Watering-places,
where the bourgeoisie attempt to escape from the effects of the heat, are not places
where crimes against persons <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>occur in great numbers. Yet the concentration of many people in a limited space is
there very great. The degree of cultivation of the people determines the greater or
less ease with which quarrels arise. And what proves that this degree need not be
very high is the fact that acts of violence are very rare among the bourgeois, the
greater number of whom have only a superficial culture.
</p>
<p>The most convincing proof that the increase of violent crimes in spring has no direct
connection with the heat, is found in the fact that this increase is already very
great in the months in which in the North of Europe there is absolutely no question
of heat properly so called (<i>i.e.</i> in March and April); and in the second place the course of crimes during the week
must be noted, with the maximum on Sunday, when naturally the heat is no greater than
on other days; and in the third place, the maximum is not to be found at the hottest
time of the day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13623src" href="#xd31e13623">35</a>
</p>
<p>The increase of sexual crimes in hot seasons is in part only apparent, because those
who commit these crimes then operate more out of doors, and a greater number of arrests
results. For the rest, it must be conceded that the sexual instinct in general is
quickened a little during the spring and summer, and as a consequence sexual acts
increase. But this does not mean that these acts are therefore criminal. The principal
reason why sexual crimes increase during the hot weather is to be found in opportunity,
which occurs much more frequently than in cold weather. The proverb says: “opportunity
makes the thief”, and this is still more applicable to sexual criminals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13628src" href="#xd31e13628">36</a>
</p>
<p>I am therefore of the opinion that the social factors must not be included in the
etiology of crime. They have their influence upon the structure of society, they have
also their influence upon man, but it depends upon social conditions whether this
influence takes a criminal direction or not.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13652src" href="#xd31e13652">37</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before taking up our analysis of “<span lang="it">Socialismo e criminalità</span>”, I would remark that this division of the factors into three groups has to do exclusively
with the individual criminal, and thus loses sight of the question why such an action
in any place whatever, at any time whatever, is regarded as criminal? Such a query
brings out the fact that we are here concerned with social factors only.
</p>
<p>Let us take up now the exposition of Chapter I of “<span lang="it">Socialismo e criminalità</span>.” Turati, in his “<span lang="it">Il delitto e la questione sociale</span>” has made the following objections to Professor Ferri’s theses. Professor Ferri distinguishes
five categories of criminals: insane criminals, incorrigible born-criminals, habitual
criminals, criminals from passion, and occasional criminals. In the first two categories
individual factors play a very important rôle; however, according to Professor Ferri’s
investigations these two groups include but 20% to 25% of the whole number of criminals,
and deducting the insane, only 10% remain. Since criminals form only the minority
of the population, and physical factors have only a slight influence, it follows that
these factors influence rather the form than the cause of the crime. The three factors
work nearly all the time. It is clear, therefore, that the two other factors alone
will not be strong enough to produce crime at a time when the social factor is eliminated,
as has been proved by the socialistic colony at New Lanark, which preserved an exemplary
morality for four years. Then, without taking account of the crimes that are the consequence
of viciousness of life or of the abnormal economic condition, the authors of great
crimes (except technical and professional ones) are less numerous among the well-to-do
than among the lower classes, where the anthropological elements are nearly the same.
And if the different classes show anthropological differences, this is not because
these differences are innate in individuals on account of being born in the lower
classes, but because they are produced and brought about by poverty, bad education,
etc. The true causes of crime are consequently social conditions, and in the last
analysis economic conditions.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri’s argument against what has just been said may be summed up as follows:
Will there be no social atmosphere in a socialistic state? Or rather, will this atmosphere
be so perfect that the germ of the smallest social factor of crime will be absent?
Do we suppose that when poverty is suppressed, jealousy will disappear at the same
time? If legal marriage is abolished will that prevent an ugly man from violating
or killing a beautiful woman who refuses to accept him? It may be objected that in
this case the man is not <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>an habitual or an occasional criminal, but a born-criminal, or an insane criminal,
or a criminal from passion. Well and good, but then in this future state we shall
still be far removed from an earthly paradise.
</p>
<p>Turati commits the following errors in his reasoning: First, he sets aside the insane
criminals; wrongly, according to Professor Ferri, for, although insane, they are criminals.
Second, 20%, the figure to which born and insane criminals count up, is a very large
number out of 60,000 prisoners. Third, Professor Ferri claims that it is incorrect
to say that the other causes are reduced to zero the moment the social factors of
crime are suppressed. For even with occasional criminals, where the environment plays
a very important part, an individual factor must make its effect felt, or the individual
would not become criminal.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri asks, on the other hand: How does it happen that out of a hundred
working-men living in the same environment, only a very few fall into crime? This
can be explained only by admitting individual and physical causes. When socialists
say that these individual differences are innate simply in consequence of the poverty
in which ancestors of the persons in question have lived for thousands of years, the
author admits this reasoning in great part, but thinks nevertheless that he is right
in maintaining that these qualities are <i>innate</i> in certain individuals at the present time.
</p>
<p>With regard to the fact that a very high morality was maintained in New Lanark, the
author says: first, that he would very much like to convince himself with his own
eyes, especially since he has read that in this colony the habit of celebrating Christmas
eve with excessive drinking was kept up; second, that he knows that crimes were committed
in a communistic colony of that time; further we are not to forget that difficulties
are increased in a great city.
</p>
<p>The following chapter is entitled: “<span lang="it">Benessere e criminalità</span>.” To the unproved assertion of the socialists that bad economic conditions are the
principal if not the only cause of crime, the author opposes some facts to prove that
this statement is largely incorrect. To this end he divides crimes into three groups:
first, crimes against property, second, crimes against persons or crimes of blood,
and third, crimes against morals. Besides these three categories there are many crimes
which have neither directly nor indirectly any connection with bad economic conditions;
for example, crimes against honor, insults, or abuse of power.
</p>
<p>First, then, the crimes against property. The author recognizes <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>that most of these crimes are caused by bad economic conditions. But it is an exaggeration,
he says, to say that all these crimes result from such conditions. This is to overlook
crimes against property committed out of revenge. However, in a communistic society
there would necessarily be cases of theft still, without taking into account kleptomania,
etc. For the articles of consumption would still remain private property; and why
should one not rob his fellow-citizen from jealousy? Or is it not probable that someone
would prefer to take from his neighbor the thing he needs rather than make a trip
of some miles to get it from a central store? But if we admit that the bad economic
conditions of the time are the cause of the crimes against property, it remains to
find the causes of the crimes of the other groups. Though he recognizes that economic
conditions occupy a place in the etiology of these last crimes, as, for example, murder
from cupidity, the author does not believe that this can be made a general rule. When
socialists object that the man of the future will be morally improved, Professor Ferri
is of the opinion that at the present moment we have to do with the men of today and
not with the men of the future.
</p>
<p>The study of criminality in France during the years 1825–80 has shown an extraordinary
increase in crimes against persons and against morals during the years 1848–52. A
minute examination shows the author that it was due to the great increase in the consumption
of meat and wine, both very cheap at this time, and also to a rise in wages. The result
of the betterment in economic conditions was, therefore, an increase in the crimes
mentioned.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri finds another proof in the following table:

<p>It follows from this table that the farming class, which, if you except vagabonds,
is the class with the least means, shows the figure relatively lowest, and that the
assertion of the socialists, that those who are brought to the bar of justice are
almost all from the proletariat, is inaccurate.
</p>
<p>—I shall not discuss the question, whether the proletariat furnishes a disproportionately
large contingent of criminals. The arguments of Professor Ferri do not seem very strong
to me. “Agricultural class”, for example, is too vague a distinction. What an enormous
distinction between the rich farmer and the poor day-laborer, who earns only a few
francs a week! Yet both are included in the first group.—
</p>
<p>When we examine the course of crime in France during the period 1826–80, we see a
considerable increase in the crimes against property, morals, and persons, while the
economic conditions have improved during these years even for the proletariat. To
what cause is this increase to be ascribed? It is impossible to attribute it to a
relaxation of the strictness of the police and the courts, for the activity of these
has become greater. Further, where it is evident that there are such strong causes
of crime, it would be madness to think that a greater severity of penalties leads
to a diminution of criminality. It is for this reason that the school to which the
author belongs insists not upon the increase of penalties, but rather upon the elimination
of causes. Hence the doctrine of “penal substitutes.”
</p>
<p>The true cause is the following: The more abundantly a man is nourished, the more
his organic forces are developed; there is, therefore, a greater activity which may
express itself in more acts of honest labor, but may also express itself in an increased
number of unlawful acts. And then we must not lose sight, especially with regard to
sexual crimes, of the existence of a biological and of a sociological law, namely,
first, that the generative force of animals and of man increases in proportion to
the abundance and ease of nutrition; second, that by a continual development of foresight,
the nations which follow the advice of Malthus are more and more giving the lie to
the law that he formulated, since with them population shows a tendency to increase
less rapidly than the means of existence, and almost in inverse proportion to wealth.
This is why criminality is increasing in France, where the system of foresight is
greatly developed, and where the population enjoys better nutrition than formerly.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri is of the opinion that we can derive from the observed <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>facts the following rules: first, criminality increases in extent but diminishes in
violence; second, scarcity makes crimes against property increase, and decreases those
against persons, while abundance has the opposite effect; third, civilization decreases
the number of homicides, but increases that of suicides; fourth, a development of
foresight with regard to births prevents an excessive increase of the population,
and consequently an excessive increase of pauperism, but increases the figures for
sexual crimes.
</p>
<p>Turati makes the following objections to these statements: In the first place, in
civilized countries, crimes against persons are much less numerous than crimes against
property, and just in proportion to the degree of civilization. Why is it not likely
that in the end the criminogenous influence of nutrition will disappear in consequence
of the law in accordance with which crimes increase in number, but decrease in grossness
and intensity? Further, it is doubtful whether this influence is so strong. The true
cause is not good nutrition but the Malthusian check, and it is this last which leads
to crime, precisely in the proletariat, since in this class prostitution cannot act
as a safety valve; and bad economic conditions are the cause of the “moral restraint.”
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri recognizes that there is a partial truth in this reasoning, but makes
the following objections: that crimes of blood are more numerous than crimes against
morals and yet have no relation to the Malthusian check; that, as regards crimes against
morals, it is not correct to say that the proletariat are driven to them by economic
causes; that it is the <span class="corr" id="xd31e13920" title="Source: proletariano">proletarians</span> that multiply the fastest, and the well-to-do classes<span></span> who do not wish to have many children; and that the individual and biological factors
would always remain, and lead to crimes against persons, even if the aforesaid cause
of sexual crimes were to disappear. In the following chapters the author treats of
the assertion of Turati that an improvement in education and the new “social atmosphere”
will bring about a change.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—The criticism of the chapter of which I have just been speaking may be summed up
as follows: Like so many other authors, Professor Ferri understands the expression,
“economic conditions”, in a very limited sense. He includes only direct influences,
and in this way it is very easy to prove that they explain only a part of criminality.
But this interpretation is very incomplete, since all social life is influenced by
economic conditions. In proving, therefore, like many other authors, that while an
improvement in the economic condition <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>of the working-class is accompanied by a decrease in crimes against property, it is
also accompanied by an increase of sexual crimes and crimes against persons, Professor
Ferri forgets not only that the lack of education leads to crimes of violence, but
also that in our present society the possibility of satisfying the sexual appetites
depends upon the social position of the individual. The argument, in opposition to
Turati, “that Malthusianism is applied chiefly by persons of some means” is not a
happy one for one who wants to prove that economic conditions have not a considerable
influence. For the reason of this is just the difficulty of procuring a good position
for many children, and, in the case of landholders, the desire to avoid a too great
division of the land. These are purely economic causes.—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“<span lang="it">Educazione e criminalità</span>” is the title of the third chapter. The human brain is an organic mechanism, similar
(but with numerous exceptions) to an inorganic mechanism in this, that it is subject
to the great law of the conservation of energy, which manifests itself, among other
ways, in inertia. From which it comes that man at all times has had an irresistible
tendency to make use of a general principle as a basis for his logical structures.
Without this he would always be forced to build each new structure from the ground
up, which would involve the waste of too much cerebral energy. Opposed to this law
is another which teaches us that life is impossible in a state of absolute repose,
but that it requires a perpetual changing of the organic and physio-psychic materials.
Hence it comes that eternal and absolute truths change at different epochs, and that
they seem stable only when compared with the secondary truths, which are subject to
the fashions of the time.
</p>
<p>According to the author, then, there are truths that are more general and nearly inalterable,
but there are others which, though general also, are more secondary, only retain their
force during several generations, and end by being changed. Such, for example, are
the views concerning human life, formulated by the great thinkers, then accepted by
the majority, and finally supplanted by other truths. This is why science makes progress
by dogmas. It is modern science that has made the great step in recognizing that these
dogmas are relative and alterable.
</p>
<p>Against this reasoning two objections can be alleged. First, that Spencer has given
the name “hypothesis” to his doctrine of evolution, while Professor Ferri calls it
a dogma. The author on the other hand thinks that his opinions and those of Spencer
are exactly alike, <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>for he calls the doctrine in question a relative and alterable dogma, and Spencer
says of it: what I have given is an hypothesis; but so long as there is nothing better,
that will explain a greater number of facts, I have a right to consider it as the
image of the knowable truth, until the contrary is proved. In the second place, it
may be asked: “Does man always oscillate between truth and error; will he never know
an absolute and eternal truth?” According to Professor Ferri the answer to this question
is not difficult. The origin as well as the aim of faith is the effort to give to
men a relatively stable support, which they cannot find elsewhere. All discussion
with the adherents of a theological opinion is excluded; and as for the others, ought
they not to recognize that the life of human thought is just the constant proof of
the continual modification of the so-called eternal verities?
</p>
<p>After this introduction the author enters upon the subject itself. At the beginning
of the 19th century the dogma was dominant, that instruction was the panacea for all
crimes. Later many of the publicists, including the socialists, advanced the opinion
that the true remedy for criminality was education. Just as the first theory was incorrect,
Professor Ferri would show that the second is equally so.
</p>
<p>The question is, can education lead man to good or to evil; and if it can, how far
can it lead him? The scientific pedagogues have not treated this question, as far
as the author knows. Without furnishing proofs the socialists admit that education
can modify man in many respects. Owen, for example, says: “every child may be brought
up to have in his later life only good habits, or bad, or a mixture of the two, according
to his education.”
</p>
<p>It is necessary to distinguish three kinds of education—physical, intellectual, and
moral. First, a general observation applicable to all kinds of education. In his physical,
intellectual, and moral make-up, each individual is the product of a countless number
of ancestors, to whom he is bound by unchangeable laws of heredity. From this it is
clear that the power of education, which acts only during a limited number of years,
is small compared to that of the influences to which a man’s ancestors have been subjected
for thousands of years. The question becomes, then: “what are the limits of such modification?”
Further it is necessary to determine just how far this modification is due to education,
and how far to environment. For education, properly so called, <i>i.e.</i> the direct and methodical influence of the educator upon his pupil, differs in many
respects from that of the physical and social environment. This is why the author
treats this latter in a special chapter, and limits himself now <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>to education alone. The question is therefore reduced to this: “how far can a man
(the educator) modify the constitution of another man (the pupil)?”
</p>
<p>One more observation should precede the study of the question, namely that a force,
or a complexus of forces, can be influenced only by other <i>homogeneous</i> forces. Now when we examine how far physical or biological education can make its
influence felt, we see that this influence may be very great, though naturally limited,
in proportion to the knowledge we have of the structure and functioning of the organs
which it is attempted to modify. As to intellectual education, the results are much
less, since the knowledge of the organs involved is much smaller. As to moral education,
the following question is one to which pedagogues have given little attention: “how
far do morality or immorality, good or bad character, depend upon the education received
at home and in school?”
</p>
<p>Spencer lays down the fundamental rule that the <i>moral</i> conduct of man can be studied scientifically only on condition of being considered
as forming part of the conduct in general, and also of the activity in general, of
all living beings. Sergi is of the same opinion. And this is correct, Professor Ferri
thinks, if, as these two authors do, one studies the conduct and character of man
in their constituent elements, in their genesis and development, without taking into
consideration the variability of the character, and consequently of the conduct, of
man because of his education. In our case, in studying the constituent elements, the
genesis, the development, and the variability of the moral part of the character and
conduct of man, it is necessary to separate these parts, and to limit ourselves to
a special study of one of them.
</p>
<p>All psychologists are agreed that the moral conduct of a man (including criminal conduct)
although having naturally a certain relationship with his muscular and intellectual
condition, depends directly and intimately upon the condition of his feelings, emotions,
and passions in their moral aspect. Hence it is clear that the problem is: “how far
can these feelings be modified by education?”
</p>
<p>Let us first of all note that the expression, “a man of good (or bad) birth”, does
not imply that there are persons who are totally good or totally bad, for these two
qualities always appear in combination. It only indicates whether the good or the
bad qualities predominate.
</p>
<p>It is certain that some persons have become criminals from lack of moral education,
added to bad surroundings. In this case this lack of education has favored the greater
development of the bad <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>germs, which, however, gives us no right to conclude that the converse would be true:
that education can improve the moral character, strengthening the good germs to such
a point that they have the mastery over the bad. For we must not lose sight of two
things: first, that the bad germs that show themselves in our present society are
the anti-social instincts, opposed to the sociability and sympathy upon which life
is based, while the good germs are the social instincts; second, that, since individuals
reproduce morphologically and physiologically during life the different phases that
man and animal have gone through, it is in the lowest strata of his character that
man preserves the savage and anti-social feelings that are the consequences of the
condition in which the race has lived heretofore, while the germs of the modern social
ideas are to be found in the higher and more recent parts. Hence it follows that the
anti-social instincts, being of a more ancient date than the social instincts, are
stronger than they and are not stifled by them. And then, the environment, the present
civilization, is also partly the cause. This is why the author agrees with Sergi that
in our present society there are individuals who are constantly driven to crime by
their organic and psychical constitution, made up in great part of the deeper, anti-social
strata (the born-criminals and incorrigibles), and that there are others whose constitution
is formed primarily of the more recent, social strata, and who become criminal only
under extraordinary impulses, in consequence of a volcanic eruption, as it were, from
the deeper, anti-social strata (criminals from passion). While Sergi is of the opinion
that the anti-social instincts will little by little become latent, lose their force,
and cease to act, Professor Ferri thinks that this will be the case only with the
minority of men.
</p>
<p>Now in order to weaken the anti-social tendencies, it is, according to the author,
necessary to know, first, their seat; second, their composition. Up to the present,
psychology has made no study of the human passions, emotions, and feelings, and consequently
cannot give us this information. It must therefore be considered as impossible that
education should so stifle the existing bad germs and strengthen the good ones that
these last should finally have the upper hand.
</p>
<p>Moral education consists only of a series of auditory and visual sensations, impressed
upon the individual by means of advice and example, which brings it about that it
is more especially a moral <i>instruction</i>, which makes its mark in the intellect, but leaves intact the seat of the passions
and feelings, which are the true motive forces <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>of the moral conduct. Moral education becomes little by little more systematic, bases
itself more than formerly upon the biological principle that each organ and function
is developed by exercise, and consequently is improving. The author believes that
we must nevertheless not deceive ourselves into fancying that too much has been accomplished,
so long as the origin and condition of the moral and immoral germs are unknown. Further,
he is of the opinion that the product of centuries is not to be destroyed in a few
years.
</p>
<p>In order to prove what has just been said the author cites the following example,
which, according to him, is not uncommon. A family includes four or five children;
all are reared with the greatest care, each in a different manner according to his
character. The result is that three or four of them become more or less good and industrious
citizens, while one becomes an incorrigible vagabond. This difference does not depend
upon education.
</p>
<p>Now it will be asked: is education, then, always and altogether useless? Here a distinction
must be made. There is one small category of persons who are good and honorable and
remain so under all circumstances, and this exclusively from their organic condition.
Opposed to this is another group who are always bad and show anti-social instincts.
These last are such from an innate organic and psychic anomaly. Between these two
is to be found the very numerous class of individuals in whom the good and bad qualities
are combined. For this last class education may be of some importance, but environment
is still more so. Hence, in order to lower the number of occasional criminals, criminal
sociology demands “penal substitutes.” For it is from this intermediate class that
criminals are recruited. However, environment and education are of less importance
for this category than heredity.
</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn by the author are, then: first, that a development of the physiology
and psychology of the human passions is very desirable, in order to improve the means
at the disposal of education; and second, that the opinion of Owen, that education
can make a bad man good, is incorrect.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—In my criticism I shall limit myself to the principal questions. In the first place
I believe that the argument of Professor Ferri, based on the supposition that scientific
socialists believe that “education is the omnipotent fact”, is futile. For scientific
socialists do not hold this opinion. Owen (who belongs to the Utopists) might be thought
to hold it, though he does not use the word education in <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>the narrow sense given by Professor Ferri, but it will be very difficult to find such
an opinion in Marx, or Engels, or any of their followers. Although holding that circumstances
have a very great influence upon the individual, they do not attribute this to the
systematic, conscious influence of one individual upon another, which is what is commonly
meant by education. For the purposes of Professor Ferri’s argument it may be very
useful to make a nice distinction between education and atmosphere, but this distinction
is not therefore justified. The impressions gained by a child whether from the atmosphere
in which he lives or deliberately impressed upon him by his teacher, are hardly distinguishable.
Just out of class he plays with his comrades, and this easily makes him forget the
moral lessons he has just received. A mother forbids her child to do a certain thing,
and a little later he sees an older member of the family do with impunity what has
been forbidden in his own case. It is because of this over-nice distinction that the
argument of the author loses much of its value.
</p>
<p>In the second place, as the author himself partly admits, the influence that education
<i>may</i> exert cannot be exactly fixed, no matter what progress pedagogical science may make,
for the following reasons. It is only in school that the scientific pedagogical method
is applied, and plainly in an incomplete and imperfect manner. In order that children
shall be taught and developed they must be well fed and well clothed. Without this
the results will be very small, but pupils insufficiently fed and clothed are to be
counted by thousands. It is also necessary that a class include as few pupils as possible,
in order that the instructor may not have to divide his attention too much. Yet how
many cases are there where this is found? For these reasons, to which might be added
others, all of an exclusively economic nature, the school does not contribute as much
as it might to moral education. The advantage of the education given in school over
that furnished by the parents consists in its practical application, at least in part,
according to pedagogical rules. The parents who set themselves to bring up their children
on scientific principles are so few as to be easily counted. Almost all are novices
in this very difficult trade; little attention is paid to whether parents are ignorant
or educated, good or bad, patient or irascible, capable or incapable, in short, of
bringing up their children. The present organization of society is based upon the
fiction that the person who gives life to a child is also fitted to bring it up. Further,
existing social conditions put many parents, however capable they <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>might otherwise be, in a position where they cannot give their children any care,
on account of the long working-day, the labor of married women, etc. These remarks,
it seems to me, are in themselves enough to show that we cannot just now come to a
definite conclusion, that the influence of education may extend to such and such a
point, but no further.
</p>
<p>In the third place, it remains to make valid objections to the principal thesis that
forms the foundation of the chapter. Here it is in brief. There was a time when men
lived in anti-social conditions; all were enemies one of another. This situation lasted
for ages until the social sentiments grew up and civilization developed. But these
anti-social germs having lasted for ages, while the social germs are only of recent
date, it follows that the former are generally much stronger than the latter. This
is why the tendency to evil has predominated in man, and why crime has such enormous
dimensions.
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that this argument is based upon an error. In Part II of this
work I shall attempt to show that the opinion of Professor Ferri (and other authors),
that in the early ages all men were enemies and animated by anti-social feelings,
is false. I shall endeavor also to show that the present constitution of society does
not give rise to social feelings, but anti-social. Finally it is very problematical
whether the hypothesis the author uses, namely that acquired characteristics may be
inherited, is defensible; the contrary is coming more and more to be believed. But
we cannot in any case admit the transmission of morality itself by heredity, as Professor
Ferri does, when he speaks of men who remain good under all circumstances, and consequently
of men who must have been born with innate moral prescriptions. A child is never born
with <i>positive knowledge</i>; he is born with a brain more or less fitted for the reception and development of
knowledge. There was never a child who, from his birth, knew the rules “thou shalt
not steal”, “thou shalt not kill”, etc. But the organs destined to become the seat
of morality differ with each individual like other organs. When the author says, then,
that there are men who remain good under all circumstances, he says, in effect, that
there are men whose moral organs are very susceptible, and who consequently remain
better than men whose organs are less susceptible. Therefore the accumulation of anti-social
feelings in man of the present day, through heredity, is imaginary. Finally, Professor
Ferri neglects to note the difference in nature and intensity between the needs of
different men. For this is the cause of the great inequality of results obtained from
the same <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>education given to persons of equal capacity for receiving moral impressions. If a
man has great needs it takes a much more intense moral effort to keep him from satisfying
them in an immoral manner, than is the case with a man whose needs are slight.—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The following chapter, “<span lang="it">Ambiente e criminalità</span>”, begins with the assertion of Professor Ferri that the thesis of the socialists
concerning the influence of the social atmosphere upon all the manifestations of human
activity, and consequently upon criminality, is in great measure correct. The difference
between the views of socialism and of sociology, therefore, is here only a question
of limits.
</p>
<p>According to the author here is the thesis in question: as soon as the social revolution
or transformation which the socialists desire has taken place, the social atmosphere
will become excellent, and man will then be morally higher than he is at present.
He then examines the parts of this statement one by one.
</p>
<p>First, Professor Ferri gives the classic formula of historic materialism, set forth
by Marx in his “<span lang="de">Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</span>”, taken by the author, however, from Loria’s criticism of the work of Puviani in
the “<span lang="it">Rivista critica delle scienze giuridiche e sociali</span>.” “In the memorable preface to the <i lang="de">Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i>, published in 1859, Marx sets forth for the first time the daring theory that all
the manifestations of mankind, in the juridic order as well as in the religious, philosophical,
artistic, criminal, etc., are <i>exclusively</i> determined by economic relations, so that to each phase of these there corresponds
a different form of human manifestations, as its necessary product.”
</p>
<p>Just as in biology the phenomena of nutrition are related to the other vital phenomena,
so is the economic aspect of human activity related to the other aspects. Economic
conditions have, then, a great influence on the social life, but the author believes
it an exaggeration to say that economic conditions fix it <i>exclusively</i>. Further, in this statement no attention is paid to the fact that the other phenomena
react in their turn upon the economic conditions, and therefore become determining
factors.
</p>
<p>Then it is said that man will be morally better when he finds himself in a purified
atmosphere. This the author admits in part—how far he admits it will be easily understood
by one who knows his opinion with regard to the physical, individual, and social factors
of crime, and his ideas about education.
</p>
<p>Like most of the statements of the socialists, this has, according <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>to Professor Ferri, the fault of being too simple and consequently too absolute. Human
life is already so complicated (and social life still more so) that only very little
can be explained by simple formulae. It is easy to say, “Abolish private property
and all the cases of theft will disappear”; “abolish legal marriage, and adultery,
uxoricide, infanticide, and the other crimes against morality will disappear.” But
it is not therefore true. For, even in a communistic society a born-vagabond, who
has a constitutional aversion to work, will commit thefts just the same. To all this
it may be objected that these cases are pathological, and that these persons should
be shut up in an insane asylum—but in reasoning thus one admits at the same time that
such a society would not yet be an earthly paradise. Further it is pure metaphysics
to believe that social institutions like property and the family are the consequences
of a caprice of man or of a dominant class, and can therefore be abolished by a stroke
of the pen. Everything that exists, in nature as in society, is the result of causes
that are only the links in an infinite chain. Hence it is impossible to modify society
at a stroke, in accordance with a plan drawn up by a theorist. This does not mean
that <i>every</i> modification of society is excluded; but the situation predicted by the socialists
is so much more beautiful than the present that it would not be a step, but a leap,
forward. And by their prediction they deny evolution, for they constantly preach to
the proletariat that the whole will be realized in the very near future.
</p>
<p>We come now to the major premise of the socialistic thesis, namely the social revolution
or transformation. The question which Professor Ferri puts to the socialists in regard
to the matter is this: how long will it take you to realize your projects? There are
two answers to be given according as one believes this realization possible by revolution
or by evolution.
</p>
<p>First, that by revolution. Leaving out of consideration the fact that a revolution
could not take place without cruel acts being committed, with a consequent upsetting
of the moral feelings, it must first of all be asked whether it is easy to bring about
a revolution. The author is of the opinion that Laveleye is perfectly right when he
says: “that a revolution has become an easy thing; that a social evolution is inevitable;
but that a social revolution is impossible, since one cannot change by force in a
single day the economic constitution of society.”
</p>
<p>Neither the word nor the fact of revolution inspires the author with <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>fear. He recognizes that it may be in the line of evolution, although it remains an
exception and is in fact a pathological manifestation of evolution. Nevertheless the
question arises, what does the revolution of a day, a month, or even a year signify
in comparison with the evolution that goes on during thousands of years? Does not
a revolution always lead to a reaction? Suppose, however, that this reaction does
not happen; will the whole people have become more moral at a single shock? What did
the great French Revolution accomplish? Much, in appearance; in reality, little. It
follows from what has gone before that we can modify the environment in a way and
with a rapidity that will seem great to one generation but not at all great to the
whole of humanity.
</p>
<p>Now the solution by evolution. As we have already remarked, Professor Ferri recognizes
that criminality will be diminished by an improvement of the environment. However,
since it is impossible to make all at once general and substantial changes, it is
necessary to make every effort to obtain partial improvements. This is why the positive
penal school defends the doctrine of “penal substitutes.” In his “<span lang="it">Il delitto</span>, etc.”, Turati calls them palliatives; he says that it is impossible to find a specific
remedy for each crime; that there is only one universal remedy: the equal distribution
of wealth, education, and the happiness coming from love and knowledge, in so far
as this will be socially possible. Professor Ferri thinks that Turati’s objections
are not based upon good reasons, because, first, the theory of penal substitutes is
not limited to the designation of special means of treating special crimes, but it
gives also universal means for all kinds of crimes; second, the improvements suggested
by the author and his adherents have the great advantage of having been drawn up according
to scientific researches, and of being immediately practicable. How could the desired
transformation ever be reached if the whole system of penal substitutes were only
a useless palliative?
</p>
<p>There are only two roads leading to success; that of a violent revolution—which Turati
rejects—and that of successive improvements. But it is just this which the positive
penal school desires, and this is why the difference between this school and the scientific
socialists has entirely disappeared. However, the error of the socialists is always
that they want to get everything at one blow, and they attach too little value to
what is within reach. There are many socialists who fear that the bourgeoisie will
never give up their privileges without force, and who consequently have still much
sympathy <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>with revolution. However, this fear is not well founded. For most social improvements
have been made by the dominant class without being compelled by revolutionary force.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri draws the conclusion that the social environment is circumscribed
by economic conditions for the most part, and that these have a very great influence
upon criminality. The socialists and the evolutionary sociologists differ, then, in
this, that the first believe they can make themselves useful by protesting and prophesying,
while the others think that it is more practical and more scientific to apply themselves
to partial improvements.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—One cannot read this chapter without being astonished at the decided tone with which
the author declares himself against a theory which he only knows from what he has
heard said about it. The classic formula of historic materialism is quoted at second
hand from a criticism of Professor Loria upon a work of Puviani, who says that the
economic evolution is in its turn determined by the constant increase of the population
(a theory entirely opposed to that of Marx).
</p>
<p>And how the idea of this theory is treated! Let the reader judge for himself. In the
original we read: “In the social production of their life men enter into fixed, necessary
relationships in production, independent of their will, relationships which correspond
to a definite stage in the development of their material powers of production. The
sum total of these relationships forms the economic structure of society, the real
basis upon which the juristic and political superstructure is erected, and to which
definite forms of social consciousness correspond. The form of production of the material
life conditions the social, political, and intellectual life-process in general. It
is not the consciousness of mankind that determines their being, but their social
being that determines their consciousness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14052src" href="#xd31e14052">38</a> 3
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for us to linger over this point. Professor Loria has stated the
theory inaccurately, and Professor Ferri, who has depended upon Loria, combats something
that Marx never said, and thinks that he has discovered the further error that account
is not taken of the fact that each cause is in its turn an effect, and vice versa.
This too it is an injustice to impute to the founders of historic materialism. Engels
says upon this subject: “… according to the materialistic conception of history, production
and reproduction <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>of the material life are, in the last analysis, the determining factors in history.
Marx and I have never claimed more. When the proposition is distorted thus: the economic
factor is the <i>sole</i> determinant, the proposition is transformed into one devoid of sense, abstract, absurd.
The economic situation is the basis, but the different factors of the superstructure—political
forms of the struggle of the classes and its results—constitutions imposed by the
victorious class after the battle has been won, etc.—juridical forms, and also the
reflections of all these actual conflicts in the minds of those who have taken part
in them, political, juridical, and philosophical theories, religious conceptions,
and their ulterior development into systems of dogmas, have also their influence upon
the march of the historic struggles, and especially in many cases determine the <i>form</i> of it. All these factors act the one upon the other, and finally the economic movement
ends necessarily by dominating over the infinite crowd of chances.… Without this the
application of the theory to any historic period would be easier than the solution
of a simple equation of the second degree.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14066src" href="#xd31e14066">39</a>
</p>
<p>Among the reproaches that Professor Ferri throws at the head of the socialists there
is also that they wrongly believe it possible to change society at a single stroke.
The author adds here some observations upon revolution and evolution. It is necessary
to take up this question, since again Professor Ferri does not correctly represent
the opinions of the Marxists. There is no question that Marx and his adherents do
not suppose that they can change society at a stroke. Although evolutionists, Marx
and his followers call themselves revolutionists. Many of their adversaries consider
this a contradiction. I think that they are wrong, and that on the contrary the opposite
is true, that every evolutionist in social matters who is not a revolutionist, has
not the courage to support the consequences of his doctrine. For he who believes that
society constantly undergoes <i>quantitative</i> changes ought to recognize that these must lead in the long run to a <i>qualitative</i> difference, in which case a <i>revolution</i> has taken place. The Marxists are consequently at once evolutionists and revolutionists,
since, recognizing that there are continual quantitative changes, they strive for
the total overturning of society as based upon the capitalistic system, and consequently
for the foundation of the socialistic order. All this relates, then, only to an economic
and social revolution. It follows, then, logically from what has <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>gone before that the scientific socialists do not aspire primarily to a political
revolution; on the contrary they wish to attain their ends <i>as far as possible</i> by legal means; <i>as far as possible</i>, which means, if the ruling classes <i>do not prevent them</i> from obtaining by legal means what they want. But in the contrary case they do not
dread undertaking even a political revolution as soon as the proletariat shall be
sufficiently prepared and organized. Professor Ferri is further of the opinion that
there is no longer any difference between the socialists who are at the same time
evolutionists, and the sociologists, since all reach out toward quantitative changes.
However, Professor Ferri forgets to say that the abolition of the private ownership
of the means of production is not one of his “penal substitutes”, and that there is
consequently a fundamental difference, since socialists advocate only the modifications
which accord with the tendencies of collectivism.
</p>
<p>Finally, Professor Ferri is of the opinion that the bourgeoisie will voluntarily relinquish
their privileges, as the ruling classes have often already done. For this tremendous
assertion he does not give any proofs, and would find it difficult to do so.—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The title of the fifth chapter is: “<span lang="it">L’avvenire morale dell’umanità</span>.” The socialists—so the author begins—believe that there is a great difference between
them and the positivist sociologists, in that the latter consider crime as an inevitable
social evil, while the socialists see in it only a passing phenomenon. Professor Ferri,
on the contrary, claims that crime, that is, the act which endangers the conditions
of existence, as well as the penalty, the corresponding reaction, defensive or preventive,
both have their roots in the animal kingdom, and are consequently phenomena more or
less inseparable from humanity. However, this sociological induction is not to be
taken in an absolute, but in this relative sense: first, that in criminality it is
necessary to distinguish two divisions, of which the one is determined by the normal
saturation, and the second by the abnormal super-saturation; second, that the author
and his adherents do not understand by the “absolute necessity” of crime that crime
will always exist, but only that it will exist in the immediate future (19th and 20th
centuries), and that they retain this expression because they regard it as useless
and impossible to make predictions concerning times more remote than this.
</p>
<p>With regard to future morality Professor Ferri considers in this chapter the two following
socialistic theses:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>I. The struggle for existence which has hitherto reigned among men, will find no place
in the socialistic society.
</p>
<p>II. In the socialistic society, egoism, which has been the basis of the moral and
social life, will have to give place to altruism.
</p>
<p>First, then, the question of the permanence of the struggle for existence. Professor
Ferri cites here the opinions of Labusquière (“<span lang="it">Rivista internazionale del socialismo</span>,” 1880) and of Professor Loria (“<span lang="it">Discorso sur Carlo Darwin</span>,” 1882). Abridged, Labusquière says as follows: Is the struggle for existence, an
integral part of the evolution of animals, also a “<span lang="la">conditio sine qua non</span>” of the development of humanity? No, since it prevents the total development by putting
the majority of men in a most precarious situation. We cannot picture man as living
all alone. He has always lived and will always live in a society. This demands a certain
solidarity, without which a society is not imaginable. We cannot admit, then, the
necessity of a continual struggle—at least we cannot admit the necessity, on the part
of some, of receiving the fruits of the labor of others. The struggle for existence
is necessary among animals, since they are not able to produce, and consequently must
live upon such fruits as nature gives. But man can produce, and the productive forces
increase just as men support one another more.
</p>
<p>The opinion of Professor Loria is summed up as follows: the thesis that the Darwinian
theory is entirely applicable to political economy is false. It is said that it justifies
social inequality; nature being aristocratic, in society also the aristocracy occupies
the place that belongs to it. According to Professor Loria this argument is as without
sense as the argument that, since nature is a murderess, murder is justifiable. The
view in question is not a legitimate conclusion from the theory as advanced by Darwin,
but is simply a false interpretation made by some of his followers. There are no reasons
why this struggle should always exist, but we are quite justified in supposing that
it will disappear, having been but a transitory stage. For as long as egoism was the
sole human motive, the struggle for existence was a necessary condition of initiative
and progress. But altruism is more and more developing, and it is not Utopian to believe
that some day man will reach out after physical and moral perfection, not with the
aim of conquering his less-favored fellows, but with the higher aim of self-development.
We forget too much how different is the struggle for existence among animals and among
men. While in nature it is the strongest, hardiest, and most <span class="corr" id="xd31e14123" title="Source: skillful">skilful</span> who come out of the contest victorious, and consequently survive, <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>in the present contest it is not the best (the workers and the capitalists who introduce
improved methods of work), but those who are enriched by the labor of others, who
are the conquerors. In the social struggle we perceive three phenomena which do not
appear in the struggle in nature: <i>military selection</i> (which is an obstacle to the perfection of the human race); <i>sexual selection</i> (in which not strength and beauty, but money and class-prejudice determine the choice);
and the economic system (which by the accumulation of capital in the hands of a few,
forces the workers to lead a life that exhausts them, and is the reason why the ill-nourished
classes form the majority). This is why the results of the struggle for existence
are so different for man from those of the combat in nature.
</p>
<p>Professor Ferri makes the following objections to what has been said above: In treating
questions like these it is necessary not to confuse two theories, that of Spencer
and that of Darwin. For the latter is connected with the former as a part with the
whole. Darwinism is expressed in the law of natural selection, while the theory of
Spencer is that of evolution, a law which rules not only the animal and human world,
but also the whole knowable universe.
</p>
<p>After this introductory observation he attacks the theses that Labusquière and Loria
have developed. The great error committed by Labusquière and by most of the socialists
is their failing to grasp the idea of the continuity and naturalness of social phenomena.
There results in such cases an erroneous distinction between societies of man and
those of animals; hence they do not see that the combat, proved as always existing
in the case of animals and men as well, is a <i>natural</i> law. And then Labusquière and his followers forget that while the sociologists explain
this combat, that is not at all saying that they justify it. In any case the assertion
of the socialists that it will be possible to make this combat cease at once, after
only a very brief delay, is false. As to the question of knowing whether it will ever
cease, this will be examined later.
</p>
<p>Then Professor Ferri remarks that we must not confuse the principle of a natural law
with its manifestations. In the case in question this would be saying that in recognizing
that the struggle for existence is a law which rules in the animal kingdom and among
men, it is necessary also to think that the <i>forms</i> of the combat have been, and remain, the same. The author believes, for example,
that it would be desirable to mitigate the present economic combat and to carry it
to a higher plane, without therefore being an adherent of the maxim, <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>“each one according to his needs”, the application of which would ruin the human race
entirely.
</p>
<p>In criticising the law of the struggle for existence, we very often forget that it
does not stand alone, but that there is another beside it, which in the long run levels
all the inequalities produced by this conflict. We see thus that individuals, families,
and races raise themselves above the general plane, reach the maximum of power, wealth,
and intelligence, to fall again below the average.
</p>
<p>We cannot admit that the struggle for existence, which is a principle of life, and
the cause of human and animal evolution, will disappear some day because men, animated
by humanitarian ideas, ardently desire it. The opinion that in the course of time
this struggle is becoming and will become less and less violent and brutal, is scientifically
more correct and humanitarian as well. It may be that after centuries and centuries
a day will come when every individual will have his <i>material</i> existence assured. But the struggle for <i>moral</i> existence will not yet disappear on that account. For every need satisfied causes
in its turn new needs to spring up, and rekindles the conflict. The socialists evince
great one-sidedness in understanding by the struggle for existence only the struggle
for food, forgetting that there is a struggle in every sphere.
</p>
<p>It is claimed that there is a great difference between the struggle for existence
among men and that among animals, and that consequently the results differ; that in
the animal kingdom it is the strongest who remain victorious, while among men it is
only a small minority of the weaker and less industrious who rule over the majority
making up the ill-nourished classes. According to Professor Ferri this opinion also
is incorrect; otherwise the consequences of the conflict would have a result entirely
contrary to that in the animal kingdom; the human race would deteriorate instead of
advancing. And the facts prove that the human race has made progress, organic, mental,
social, and economic. The survival of the weaker, the less industrious, is only partial
and apparent. Malon says that in our present society it is not those who are individually
superior who conquer, but those who have the exclusive disposition of the social forces.
But how have these forces fallen into the hands of these few? Only because <i>in this phase of human evolution</i>, they were the stronger, the best fitted. It is forgotten that there is not only
a struggle between classes, but also between individuals, and that, by the greater
and greater increase of altruism it is also the more altruistic workmen and employers
who conquer. For an altruistic <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>workman, who works with zeal and has his employer’s interests at heart, and an altruistic
employer who treats his employes well, will be more able to maintain themselves than
those who act differently. It is only in appearance, then, that the less strong and
industrious property-owners are the victors; if this were the case it would soon cease
to be so.
</p>
<p>The conclusion of the author, then, is that the struggle for existence, which is a
normal aspect of honorable activity, and an abnormal aspect in criminal activity,
is the supreme law of the human race in the past and in the present, and consequently
in the future; but this struggle will be carried on by means less and less rude and
bloody.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The second part of the chapter treats of egoism and altruism. The individual, considered
as such, is only egoistic; but considered as a member of a community he is also altruistic.
We must therefore interpret the subject in the following manner: that a gradual evolution
is taking place from egoism to altruism, between which, accordingly, is found ego-altruism.
</p>
<p>There are now two questions that must be answered, first, will man ever come to be
purely altruistic? second, if so, how long will it take to bring it about?
</p>
<p>According to the author every evolutionist must answer affirmatively to the first
question (at least if we exclude the absolute form in which it is put by many socialists,
namely that egoism will disappear entirely), for the slow and continual evolution
of morality teaches us that egoism is always decreasing and altruism increasing. But
how much time is needed to realize this moral paradise? The answers made to this question
by the socialists and by the sociologists differ greatly. The former are of the opinion
that this will be possible almost immediately, or at least in a little while, while
the latter think that it is impossible that it should take place so quickly. Since
the author has busied himself in the preceding chapters with the influence of education
upon morality he limits himself now to treating the question, <i>how much time is needed for this moral progress?</i>
</p>
<p>According to Professor Ferri we do not properly grasp this question if we do not recognize
that the evolution of morals has progressed but very slowly during the past centuries.
Doubtless much has been accomplished, but not enough to justify the prediction of
the socialists. Soury is quite right when he says: “we deceive ourselves <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>greatly if we think that the man of the present day differs much from the man of antiquity,
from the barbarian, and the savage.” When we examine the period of barbarism we see
that homicide, cannibalism, and theft form the greater part of the criminality, while
the first two are not often punished by the tribe, or are even obligatory. Impetuosity
of the passions, ferocity, insensibility to pain in self or others, disloyalty, implacable
revenge, improvidence, and superstition form the principal part of the moral life.
All these traits still exist, though less strongly than formerly, in the man of the
present, and especially in the individual born in the lower classes. Except in pathological
cases cannibalism no longer appears in the civilized world, but this does not make
it impossible that it would reappear in time of great famine. However, the high moral
qualities which present-day man can show, are also to be found among savages, only
with gradual differences.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14171src" href="#xd31e14171">40</a> The number of honorable and moral persons has increased relatively, which makes it
certain that in the future morality will rise higher than at present, but this will
not take place quickly, but very slowly, like all the other changes that have taken
place.
</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible that the predictions of the socialists should come true
in a short time, and that crime, poverty, ignorance, and immorality should disappear
as soon as society is transformed and revolutionized. It will only be the sublime
end toward which the human race must always aspire.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—In order to avoid repetitions I will make no criticism of this chapter, since I should
have to refute almost all the theses here laid down, but will treat of the questions
of the struggle for existence, and egoism and altruism, in Part II of this work.—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In his “<span lang="it">Conclusione</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14189src" href="#xd31e14189">41</a> Professor Ferri compares society to a sick person at whose bedside there meet three
friends of his, who all wish him well. The first declares confidently that the soul
dominates the body and that consequently material remedies are of no avail. The second
says, on the contrary, that it is only a total change of the environment in which
he is living that can cure the invalid. The third also believes that modifications
are necessary, but he contents himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>with partial improvements, though the second friend calls them only palliatives. The
first is the spiritualist,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14194src" href="#xd31e14194">42</a> the second the socialist, and the third the sociologist.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—Having given my opinion after each chapter, a general criticism of “<span lang="it">Socialismo e Criminalità</span>” is superfluous. The impression that the book makes is strange. The author attacks
the socialists as “excessively anti-scientific and sentimental”, while he vaunts the
“great scientific character of the sociologists.” Yet these last, notwithstanding
their great scientific character, combat a doctrine which they know only in part or
not at all. Scientific socialism is left out of the discussion.
</p>
<p>The best proof of the weakness of his attack against socialism is to be found in the
fact that the author has for several years ranked himself among the socialists, of
whom he has become one of the most fervent and intelligent chiefs.
</p>
<p>As regards his opinion on the criminal question Professor Ferri has made no change,
or almost none.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14210src" href="#xd31e14210">43</a>—

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">H. Kurella.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This author gives some pages of his “<span lang="de">Naturgeschichte des Verbrechers</span>” to the subject we have in hand. What he says may be summed up as follows.
</p>
<p>The attempts to draw parallels between the fluctuations of the price of grain and
those of the figures for criminality, according to the author, prove nothing, inasmuch
as it is impossible to compare them with the statistics of wages and of forced unemployment.
In fact any one who tries to show in this way the correlation between criminality
and economic conditions, begs the question, that poverty is the principal cause of
crime. Further, the hypothesis that the regularity with which human acts occur is
fixed by the condition of the society in which they take place, is little by little
giving <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>way. From personal examinations, and from the information given by Ferri and von Oettingen
(this proves that the literature of our subject is little known to the author) Dr.
Kurella thinks he can draw the conclusion that insufficient food, caused by scarcity
or low wages, does not cause the commission of crimes. Malnutrition may perhaps influence
criminality indirectly; that is it may cause degeneration after some successive generations,
which in its turn predisposes to crime.
</p>
<p>A priori it is incontestable that we cannot picture to ourselves a society, if established
by the socialists,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14255src" href="#xd31e14255">44</a> in which cupidity, hatred, and the instinct of the oppressor, the principal motives
of crime, will have been annihilated or deprived of their influence because of social
institutions. Nevertheless it is of importance that Morrison, Garofalo, and Ferri<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14258src" href="#xd31e14258">45</a> have, according to the author, shown that poverty is not a factor of crime. At the
International Congress of Criminal Anthropology at Brussels, the attempt was made
to defend the contrary, but, according to Dr. Kurella, without success. (According
to him it can only be in case of being suddenly thrown out of work that a person hitherto
honest commits a crime from indigence.)
</p>
<p>The necessity of the moment being consequently only rarely a cause of criminality,
not only do the present social anomalies produce an increase of degeneracy, as has
been said above, but also there are a number of persons who live in badly built and
unsanitary dwellings, so that the family life is injured, and the development of feelings
of honesty, modesty, etc., is interfered with. And it is also the social anomalies
that strongly influence alcoholism, which is one of the important factors of crime.
</p>
<p>The author draws the following conclusion: “As little as a change of environmental
conditions can change an individual of one kind immediately into an individual of
another kind, as little as we ever, under however modified circumstances, see a chimpanzee
change himself into a gorilla, so little do social factors change a normally endowed
man into a criminal. In isolated cases it may appear as if passion or opportunity
had caused a crime; social forces do indeed have their effect upon the individual,
but they do not essentially change his fundamental attributes—which include his character;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>the slight modifications through environment that individuals experience, must constantly
recur, heap themselves up in the course of generations, until a socially significant
change of type has arisen. Accordingly it is the permanent social distresses, the
chronic evils of society which influence criminality, because by unnoticeable influences
they go on for generations gnawing at the inmost kernel of man; misery and intellectual
and moral neglect must be as long continued as in the Papal States, in the Kingdom
of Naples, in Ireland, and among the Poles, drained by the territorial nobility for
centuries, before an entire people becomes <span class="corr" id="xd31e14266" title="Source: innoculated">inoculated</span> with the ‘penchant for crime.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14269src" href="#xd31e14269">46</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—I will refrain from making any criticism. One does not argue with a man who gives
convincing proofs that even the meaning of criminal sociology is unknown to him. Assertions,
for example, that the character of man is invariable, that the distance between the
honest man and the dishonest man is as great as that between the chimpanzee and the
gorilla, are only absurdities. What author will deny at this time that the differences
between men are, in the last analysis, only quantitative?
</p>
<p>In general, Dr. Kurella still shares the opinions of the Italian school (<i>cf.</i>, for example, “<span lang="de">Anthropologie und Strafrecht</span>”, which appeared in 1912); nevertheless he should have recognized, when he wrote
“<span lang="de">die Naturgeschichte des <span class="corr" id="xd31e14284" title="Source: Verbrechens">Verbrechers</span></span>”, that he was not familiar with the social factors of crime. He has written the following
remarkable words, which do him honor. “I do not hesitate to confess that deeper socio-political
studies, which became possible to me only after the publication of that work [“<span lang="de">Naturgeschichte des <span class="corr" id="xd31e14289" title="Source: Verbrechens">Verbrechers</span></span>”] show me today the social factors of crime more plainly and sharply, than I was
able to recognize them ten years ago” (<span lang="de">Vorrede</span>, “<span lang="de">Zurechnungsfähigkeit, Kriminalanthropologie</span>”).—

<p class="first">In the first chapter (on poverty and criminality in Italy) the author calls attention
to the following facts. According to the statistics <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>of 1881 there were in Italy to the thousand (of both sexes over nine years of age)
390.66 persons who were rich, well-to-do, moderately well-off, or with enough to live
on, and 609.34 who had scarcely the necessities of life. Out of 100 persons convicted
there were:

<p>Here the favorable influence of means comes out distinctly. For 40% of the population
had some means and 60% were in need; but among those convicted there were 13% with
means and nearly 87% who were poor.
</p>
<p>Then the author gives a sketch of the influence of poverty in causing degeneracy among
the proletariat and predisposing them to crime, for poverty is very destructive to
men’s mental faculties. He cites in support of this many authors of weight.

<p>According to the author this table shows that wealth and criminality present a certain
symmetry, to this extent, that the wealthy <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>regions have in general a lower criminality than the poor ones. It is only Latium
that forms an exception, which is explained, according to Dr. Fornasari di Verce,
first, by the circumstance that the capital is situated in that district, second,
by the climate, and third, chiefly by the fact that the absolute wealth of a country
gives no indication of the distribution of wealth. We can properly expect to find
that where great wealth is heaped up there will also be considerable pauperism.
</p>
<p>Not only does poverty predispose to crime, but it also furnishes the motives for it.
Leading to alcoholism it is the cause of violent crimes; it drives persons who cannot
find work to vagrancy and mendicity, which in their turn are the preparatory school
for greater crimes; it puts the great number of those who cannot provide honestly
for their needs to the necessity of stealing. And when these factors act upon a man
already predisposed, they even lead as far as homicide.

</p>
<p>According to the author it appears from this table that, with the exception of Latium,
the districts with wealth above the average have a number of crimes below the average.
Nevertheless the regions with a figure for wealth above the average, <i>i.e.</i> Piedmont-Liguria, Lombardy, and Latium, show a greater number of crimes than one
would expect, while Sicily, Naples, Marches-Umbria, and Sardinia <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>show lower figures for crime than would be supposed. This contradiction is only apparent,
according to the author, and is to be explained as follows: first, because where there
is wealth there is also poverty and frequent opportunities to steal; second, because
dangerous individuals migrate less to districts where there is less wealth; third,
because, as John Stuart Mill says, it results from the social conditions of our day
that the education of the poor is nil and that of the rich bad.
</p>
<p>The second chapter, having as its title, “<span lang="it">Il fattore economico e la delinquenza.—Dinamica</span>”, contains some data upon the trend of criminality in the period in question. Criminality
in general is increasing; serious crimes remain nearly stationary, while less serious
crimes increase. As Ferri observes, criminality is decreasing, even in Italy, as to
its intensity and violence, but increasing as to its extent.
</p>
<p>Finally, the author considers the influence of emigration. It is chiefly the crimes
against property that feel the favorable effects of it, as murder does among crimes
against persons. The cause of this favorable influence is easily explained. Emigration
removes a number of persons who, not having the means of existence, would easily become
criminals.
</p>
<p>The consequences of <i>agricultural vicissitudes</i> are as follows: the years of abundant harvests show a decrease in criminality, bad
years, on the contrary, an increase; good vintages, however, lead to the same result.
It is chiefly crimes against property (especially rural thefts) that yield to the
influence of the degree of the abundance of the harvest; while among crimes against
persons it is principally assaults that show the effect of the character of the crops.
It is plain that the agricultural class is that which especially shows the effect
of a bad harvest. During the years 1887–1889 the proportion of the farming class among
those convicted rose from 35.3% to 37.8% and 38.2%.
</p>
<p>The effect of <i>the fluctuation of the price of food</i> is the following: criminality in general shows the influence of it greatly. When
prices fall crime diminishes, and vice versa. This is more clearly to be seen in crimes
against property. Crimes against persons increase especially when the price of wine
is low, and vice versa. When a fall in the price of food coincides with a fall in
the price of wine, the increase of crimes against persons is great.
</p>
<p>According to Dr. Fornasari di Verce the cause of the increase of crimes against persons
in the case of low food prices is not to be found <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>in the improved nutrition that results, but in the greater consumption of alcohol.
The other crimes feel the effect of the fluctuations in the price of provisions less.
</p>
<p>The author then takes up <i>manufacturing</i>. (As a consequence of the defectiveness of the official statistics the data are incomplete.)
During the period of which the author speaks, manufacturing increased enormously,
and crime in general increased also. The serious forms, however, decreased while the
less serious ones increased. Industrial crises bring an increase chiefly of crimes
against persons.
</p>
<p><i>The condition of the working-people.</i> According to the author it would be of the highest importance to establish for each
year the number of industrial workers. For this has a greater importance for criminality
than the price of food or the rate of wages. In default of official data such an investigation
cannot take place, and he has to limit himself to an examination of wages. With some
few exceptions these wages increased about 35% during the period 1873–1889. However,
to obtain a clearer picture of the condition of the working-class, the author has
combined the fluctuation of wages with those of the price of grain; that is, he has
made a calculation of the number of hours each man has had to work to get 100 kilograms
of grain.
</p>
<p>After having called attention to the fact that the average wage of the Italian workman
is lower than in other industrial countries, the author gives the following results
of his researches: the influence of the fluctuation of wages upon crime in general
is less than, and almost always subordinated to, that of the fluctuation of food-prices.
However, it must not be forgotten here that wages do not always represent exactly
the condition of the majority of the proletariat. With some few exceptions, all crimes
against property decrease when wages rise (in combination with the price of grain).
This influence is not noted in commercial crimes and counterfeiting. Crimes against
persons increase a little when wages rise; but when this rise coincides with a low
price of wine, they increase considerably.
</p>
<p>The influence of <i>strikes</i> is exclusively limited to the crime of rebellion.
</p>
<p>From the investigation into criminality and <i>commercial occurrences</i> we learn that fraudulent bankruptcy, and also forgery in great measure, are almost
entirely independent of economic occurrences; and the fluctuations of the number of
commercial crimes, in so far as they are not influenced by other economic facts, are
explained in great part by commercial occurrences.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Financial occurrences</i> (credit and deposits) do not make themselves felt in criminality in general, but
in crimes against property and commercial crimes.
</p>
<p>The author concludes finally from the increase shown by <i>private fortunes</i> and the rise in wages, that there is a correlation of these phenomena with a decrease
of certain serious forms of crime.
</p>

<p>According to the author it follows from his investigation, that the economic factors
fill a very important place in the etiology of crime, but that all crime is not to
be explained by that means. He is of the opinion that if we are to combat crime effectively
we must make use of the “penal substitutes” recommended by Professor Ferri.

<p>—It is incontestable that the researches of Dr. Fornasari di Verce must be placed
in the front rank of the works that show the correctness of the thesis that the economic
factors are the most important factors of criminality. An objection may be made, however,
that the question has been conceived in too mechanical a fashion, in consequence of
the exclusive use of the statistical method. He seeks the correlation between criminality
and each economic phenomenon <i>separately</i>, in place of that of the <i>ensemble</i> of these phenomena. For <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>the economic life does not exist in reality as separated and isolated parts, but forms
a great whole, a compact mass, of which the parts fit in together. When an important
economic occurrence takes place, in case the expected effect upon crime is not observed,
we must not be too quick to say that it has no importance for criminality, for it
may be that it is neutralized by something else.
</p>
<p>With this remark is connected a final objection. The author has not proved the truth
of his conclusion that criminality cannot be explained exclusively by means of economic
conditions. For, although his researches include very important economic factors,
the author leaves out many economic factors and, with one exception (the degenerating
influence of poverty), the numerous consequences of economic conditions, which are
of the highest importance for the question in hand. In other words the author has
not called attention to the fact that we live under an economic system of a comparatively
recent date, having peculiar characteristics that are of great significance for criminality.
He has indicated some very important consequences of the system, but he has not analyzed
the system itself.
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the work that I have been treating, and which has a great
value for the subject, shows that economic conditions are of great importance for
criminality. However, it does not prove that this influence is not greater than is
shown by statistics.—

<p class="first">In the first part of his study, “<span lang="it">Criminalità e condizioni economiche in Sicilia</span>”, the author calls attention to the fact that Sicily is one of the Italian districts
where crime is greatest and is increasing most rapidly. One could draw upon the map
lines enclosing a definite criminal zone, taking in the provinces of Caltanissetta,
Girgenti, and Catania. This zone might, in its turn, be divided into two others, one
of which would give a high figure for robberies and homicides, and the other chiefly
for crimes against property and against morals.
</p>
<p>The author divides the economic causes into direct and indirect. In speaking of <i>direct factors</i> he treats successively:
</p>
<p>a. <i>Large real-estate holdings.</i> The landed proprietor rents his lands to the “gabelletto”, who in turn sublets them
to the laborers. This system exhausts the latter. The proprietor rids himself of all
expense by charging it to the “gabelletto”, and makes his profit; the “gabelletto”
does the same by the laborer and makes <i>his</i> profit. The latter is always <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>the person that suffers. Then the “gabelletto” advances the necessary provisions to
the laborer until the harvest comes in; but since he does so at a high rate, the laborer
is bowed down by the burden of his debts. In consequence of this system the agricultural
population is ill-nourished and degenerate. The consequences of this system as it
affects criminality are apparent. In the province of Caltanissetta, where large land-holdings
are the rule, crimes against property, and especially rural thefts, cattle-stealing,
vagrancy, etc., are the most numerous.
</p>
<p>b. <i>Small holdings.</i> However, it is not only the agricultural population dependent upon great property-holders
that lives in poverty, for the small farmers also have a hard life. They raise chiefly
grapes and citrous fruits. The price of citrous fruits has fallen greatly through
overproduction and foreign competition. Wine also has gone down in price, and the
cultivators have had enormous losses from phylloxera besides. Consequently the small
farmers are crushed with debts; failures are the order of the day; their situation,
then, is most unfortunate. But that of the non-property-holders is still worse if
possible. For the small holder also often rents his land to others, and from this
follows a kind of “sweating-system.”
</p>
<p>At the end of these observations the author gives, in the following table, the movement
of some prices in relation to criminality:

<p>c. <i>The mining zone.</i> The production of sulphur, formerly of great importance, when Sicily was the principal
source of supply for Europe and America, has decreased greatly now that sulphur is
manufactured from chemical products. The condition of the miners is pitiful. The mines
are often exploited by middle-men, which makes the condition of the laborers worse.
Degeneracy has consequently taken on enormous proportions. When we compare the change
in wages with the number of thefts, we see that thefts decrease when wages rise, and
vice versa, and that the price of grain also influences criminality. It is the provinces
of Sicily where the sulphur mines are found that give the highest figures for criminality
in general, and homicide in particular.
</p>
<p>d. <i>The class-conflict.</i> The property owners, whose economic position is already very influential, also control
the political forces, and consequently the case of those who have nothing is made
much worse. Taxes, indirect for the most part, weigh most heavily upon the poor; public
property is exploited for the benefit of the rich, etc., etc. Hence it follows that
in the districts where the non-possessors are unconsciously struggling against the
possessors, this strife of classes engenders class-hatred, and consequent crimes.
</p>
<p>In the last part of his study the author speaks of <i>indirect economic factors</i>, among which he includes:
</p>
<p>a. <i>The increasing decline in the altruistic feelings.</i> The miner and the laborer, both ill-nourished, humiliated, and despised, dwelling
in miserable hovels, are pariahs far removed from any feeling for their fellow men.
</p>
<p>b. <i>Organic degeneracy.</i> As a consequence of the economic conditions named, degeneracy is always increasing
more and more among the poor, especially among the miners. This degeneracy becomes
in its turn a factor of criminality, since it predisposes individuals to crime.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">A. Lacassagne.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the Italian school reigned supreme at the first congress of criminal anthropology
at Rome, Professor Lacassagne opposed it with his so-called “hypothesis of the environment”
in the following terms: “The important thing is the social environment. Allow me to
make a comparison borrowed from a modern theory. The social environment is the bouillon
for the culture of criminality; the microbe, that is the criminal, is an element which
is only of importance when it has found a medium in which it can grow.
</p>
<p>“The criminal with anthropometric and other characteristics seems to us to have only
a moderate importance. All these characteristics may be found elsewhere among honest
men.
</p>
<p>“But you should look at the different social consequences of these two points of view.
On the one hand is the fatalism which flows inevitably from the anthropometric theory;
and on the other, social initiative. If the social environment is everything, and
if it is so defective as to favor the growth of vicious or criminal natures, it is
to this environment and its conditions of functioning that our reforms must be directed.
</p>
<p>“… This phrase … sums up my whole thought, and is, so to speak, the conclusion of
what I have been saying; <i>societies have the criminals they deserve</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15682src" href="#xd31e15682">1</a>
</p>
<p>In his “<span lang="fr">Marche de la criminalité en France, 1825–1880</span>”, the author points out, among other things, the connection between criminality and
economic conditions. An examination of the movement <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>of crimes against property shows that the great fluctuations to be observed there
are intimately connected with economic conditions. The number of crimes against property
corresponds almost exactly with the fluctuation in the price of wheat; and all the
economic crises make their influence felt.
</p>
<p>During the years 1828, 1835–1837, 1847, 1848–1854, 1865–1868, and 1872–1876, in which
the price of wheat was high, there were also a great number of crimes against property.
The year 1855 was the sole exception, for then crimes against property did not increase,
although the price of grain was very high. This is to be explained by the fact that
the government then took measures to lessen the consequences of this calamity. Further,
other provisions were then very cheap. From 1860 on the number of crimes against property
decreases, which, according to the author, is to be explained by the importation of
grain, which increased greatly at this time.
</p>
<p>The influence of the production and consumption of alcohol is strongly felt in crimes
against persons, especially in assaults.
</p>
<p>I would further call attention to the report made by Professor Lacassagne to the Fourth
Congress of Criminal Anthropology at Geneva, entitled, “<span lang="fr">Les vols à l’étalage et dans les grands magasins</span>”, in which he shows how the display of goods on the counters in the great bazaars,
which are meant to fascinate visitors, and force them to buy, so to speak, leads to
crime in individuals predisposed to kleptomania.
</p>
<p>Professor Lacassagne has always remained faithful to the judgment that he pronounced
at Rome; at the Congress at Brussels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15701src" href="#xd31e15701">2</a> and at Amsterdam as well<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15707src" href="#xd31e15707">3</a>, he repeated: “Societies have the criminals they deserve.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This author considers criminality as being preëminently a social phenomenon, which,
like all social phenomena, is to be explained by imitation.
</p>
<p>“All the important acts of the social life are performed under the sway of example.
One begets, or one does not beget, through imitation; the statistics of births have
shown us that. One kills, or one does not kill, through imitation; should we have
the idea today <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>of fighting a duel, or declaring war, if we did not know that this is always done
in the country where we live? One kills himself, or he does not kill himself, through
imitation; it is recognized that suicide is an imitative phenomenon in the highest
degree.… How can we doubt, then, that a man steals or does not steal, murders or does
not murder, through imitation?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15737src" href="#xd31e15737">4</a>
</p>
<p>Imitation, says the author, is governed by two laws, namely, that men imitate one
another more the more closely they come together, and that imitation of the high by
the low is what most often takes place (that the customs of the nobility are imitated
by the people, etc.). If we test these rules in their application to crime, we shall
find that they hold good there also. The author gives the following examples, among
others, in support of this:
</p>
<p>“Vagrancy, under its thousand actual forms, is an offense essentially plebeian; but
if we go back into the past it will not be difficult to connect our tramps and street
singers with the noble pilgrims and minstrels of the Middle Ages. Poaching, another
nursery of criminals, which in the past, together with smuggling, has played a part
comparable with vagrancy in the present, is still more directly connected with the
life of the lord of the manor.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15743src" href="#xd31e15743">5</a> “Arson, a crime of the lowest classes today, was once the prerogative of the feudal
nobility. Was not the Margrave of Brandenburg heard to boast one day that he had burned
in his life 170 villages? Counterfeiting takes refuge at present in mountain caverns,
or subcellars in the city, but we know that coining was long a royal monopoly.
</p>
<p>“Finally, theft, so degrading in our day, has had a brilliant past. Montaigne tells
us, without being very indignant at it, that many young gentlemen of his acquaintance,
whose fathers did not give them enough money, procured more by stealing.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15749src" href="#xd31e15749">6</a>
</p>
<p>There was a time, then, when criminality extended itself from the higher classes to
the lower; at present new forms of crime take their rise in the great cities and spread
out into the country. The increase of crime in the cities is very considerable, and
it is very probable that, in accordance with the law cited, criminality will at length
increase in the country as greatly. It is especially the crimes of assassination,
sexual crimes against minors, abortion, and infanticide, that have increased. So the
opinion of several Italian criminologists, “that crimes against persons decrease where
crimes against property increase, and vice versa”, is wrong, according to Professor
Tarde, since both kinds of crime increase in the great cities.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>“To sum up, the prolonged action of the great cities upon criminality is manifest,
it seems to us, in the gradual substitution, not exactly of trickery for violence,
but of covetous, crafty, and voluptuous violence, for vindictive and brutal violence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15758src" href="#xd31e15758">7</a>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, civilization improves men, and the growing criminality is in opposition
to the greater and greater increase of civilization. This contradiction is explained
by the author by means of another law of imitation; the law of insertion, <i>i.e.</i> the alternate passage from fashion to custom.
</p>
<p>“All industry is thus fed by a stream of improvements, innovations today, traditions
tomorrow; every science, every art, every language, every religion obeys this law
of the passage from custom to fashion and of the return from fashion to custom, but
to an enlarged custom.
</p>
<p>“For at each of these steps in advance the territorial domain of imitation increases;
the field of social assimilation, of human brotherhood, extends itself, and this is
not, as we know, the least salutary effect of imitative action from the moral point
of view.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15770src" href="#xd31e15770">8</a>
</p>
<p>After having mentioned how these different currents of imitation meet, the author
applies the idea set forth above to the influence of education upon criminality. He
shows that instruction, by itself, is not a remedy for crime, since it may furnish
new means for committing crimes, and hence may only change the character of criminality.
Finally the author points out the influence of labor upon criminality, combating the
theory of Poletti, who says that it is necessary to take into account the economic
development (for example, if during the period 1826–78 criminality in France increased
in the ratio of 100 to 254, and productive activity was quadrupled, criminality did
not increase, but really diminished). The fundamental error in Poletti’s argument,
according to Professor Tarde is, that he considers crime as a regular, permanent,
and inevitable effect of industrialism.
</p>
<p>“Only, there is labor and labor; and if in a more laborious class the work is badly
divided, excessive for some, whom it enervates and disorders, insufficient for others,
who become dissipated, or if it is badly directed, turned toward deleterious compositions
and reading which excite the senses …—in this case it will probably happen that progress
in labor is accompanied by a growing lack of discipline and by academic vices of different
kinds. An analogous phenomenon takes place in our cities, where the mad chase for
luxury outruns the rise of wages, and where sexual crimes are sextupled or septupled
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>while wealth is tripled and quadrupled. The socialists, then, are right in imputing,
in part, to unjust distribution and to the objectionable direction of the productive
activity, the moral evil that has grown with it, and which, further, does not decrease
when productive activity becomes weaker. For since the period when Poletti made his
observations upon the prosperity of France, this has ceased to grow, and has even
decreased rapidly, as we know only too well, but crime has continued its onward march
with a more marked impetus.
</p>
<p>“In short, there remains nothing of the law laid down by this distinguished writer,
and all the statistics contradict him. Delinquency, as Garofalo remarks, is so little
proportional to commercial activity that England, where crime is on the decrease,
is the nation most remarkable for the increase of its commerce, and that Spain and
Italy, where the criminality is greater than that of the other principal states of
Europe, are far behind them in business development. We may add that in France the
most hard-working class is without any doubt the peasant class, and this shows the
smallest proportionate number of delinquents, notwithstanding unfavorable conditions.
We may conclude that work is in itself the adversary of crime, that if it favors it
it is by indirect, not necessary action, and that its relation to crime is like that
between two antagonistic forms of work.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15781src" href="#xd31e15781">9</a>
</p>
<p>In the following section the author treats the influence of wealth and of poverty
upon the criminal. He mentions the different opinions of Turati and of Colajanni on
the one hand, and of Ferri and Garofalo on the other. The former tried to prove that
poverty is often a cause of a poor man’s becoming a criminal. Garofalo tries to disprove
it by calling attention, among other things, to the fact that, according to the criminal
statistics of Italy for 1880, property owners committed as many crimes in proportion
as the proletariat did.
</p>
<p>In opposition to this Professor Tarde points out that the French criminal statistics
in 1887 show that there were, out of 100,000 of each class of the population, the
following number of persons arraigned: 20 out of the class of domestics, one of the
poorest classes; 12 from the liberal professions including persons of independent
income; 139 from the class of vagrants and persons without occupation (the most necessitous
class, therefore); 21 from commerce; 26 from manufacturing (a very high figure considering
the profits of that year); and 14 from the farming class (a very low figure considering
their relative poverty).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>The author explains these contradictions as follows: “Let us not forget that, the
desire for wealth being the ordinary motive and more and more the preponderating motive
of crime as it is the only motive of industrial labor, the possession of wealth must
keep the most dishonest man from crime as it does the most laborious man from industrial
labor—for it is impossible to desire what one has—at least if the satisfaction of
this desire has not meant the over-exciting of it.… Now in business circles, where
on account of men’s throwing one another into a fever, a constant gaining of wealth,
rather than wealth itself, is the end pursued, a fortune is like those peppered liqueurs
which arouse thirst more than they quench it. Hence it comes, doubtless, as well as
from the excitement prevailing in these circles, that criminality there is as great
as among domestic servants. In the same way, in the licentious environments, in the
great cities, where there are masses of working people, sexual crimes are as much
more numerous as the pleasures of the senses are there more easily come by. But we
can lay it down as a principle that where wealth is an obstacle to activity it is
also an obstacle to crime, very much as political power ceases to be dangerous at
the moment when it ceases to be ambitious. This is the situation among the rural proprietors,
small and great, among stockholders, and even in the majority of the liberal professions …;
content with his relative well-being, man indulges in an intellectual half-labor,
artistic rather than mechanical, honorable rather than mercenary, and abstains from
flagitious means of obtaining an increase of income which he desires moderately. The
French peasant, in general, partakes of this moderation of desires, and, rich from
his sobriety, his stoicism, his frugality, his plot of ground at last acquired, he
is happier than the feverish millionaire, financier, or politician, driven by his
very millions to sow the seed of his rotten speculations, rascalities, and extortions
upon a vast scale. Further the well-to-do agriculturists are in general the most honest
people. Let us not speak of wealth and poverty, to tell the truth, not even of well-being
and the reverse, but rather of happiness and unhappiness, and be careful how we deny
this truth, as old as the world, that the wicked man’s excuse is often to be found
in his being unhappy. Children of this century … let us confess that under its brilliant
exterior our society is not happy, and if we had no other assurances of its great
evils than its numerous crimes, without giving a thought to its suicides, and its
increasing cases of insanity, without lending an ear to the cries of envy, of suffering,
and of hatred … we should not be able to call its woes in question.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>“From what does it suffer? From its internal trouble, from its illogical and unstable
condition, from intestine contradictions, stirred up by the success even of its unheard-of
discoveries and inventions, piling one on top of the other, the material for contrary
theories, the source of unbridled, egoistic, and antagonistic desires. Upon this obscure
gestation, a great Credo, a great common end awaits; it is creation before the Fiat
Lux. Science multiplies its notions, it elaborates a high conception of the universe;
… but where is the high conception of life, of human life, that it is ready to make
prevalent? Industry multiplies its products, but where is the collective work that
it brings to birth? The preëstablished harmony of interests was a dream of Bastiat,
the shadow of a dream of Leibnitz. The citizens of a state exchange information, scientific
and otherwise, through books, newspapers, or conversation, but to the profit of their
contradictory beliefs; they exchange services, but to the profit of their rival interests;
the more they assist one another, therefore, the more they nourish their essential
contradictions, which may have been as profound at other times, but were never so
conscious, never so painful, and consequently never so dangerous.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15794src" href="#xd31e15794">10</a>
</p>
<p>Suppose, asks the author, there was no more foreign war, how could we avoid civil
war? There have, indeed been historic periods when there existed a common aim uniting
individuals, as the faith did in the Middle Ages. In our days this aim can be nothing
but “art, philosophy, the higher cultivation of the mind and imagination, the æsthetic
life.”
</p>
<p>In order to be able to answer the question whether civilization (the collective name
for education, religion, science, arts, manufacturing, wealth, public order, etc.)
causes a diminution of criminality, it is necessary to discriminate between two stages
of civilization. In the first there is an afflux of inventions; this is the stage
at which Europe is at the present time. In the second this afflux decreases and it
forms itself into a coherent whole. A civilization may be very rich, then, and but
little coherent, or very coherent and not very rich, like that of the commune in the
Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>“But is it by its wealth or by its cohesion that civilization makes crime recede?
By its cohesion without any doubt. This cohesion of religion, of science, of all forms
of work and of power, of all kinds of different innovations, mutually confirming one
another, in reality or in appearance, is a true implicit coalition against crime,
and even when each of these fruitful branches of the social tree combats but <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>feebly the gourmand branch, their agreement will suffice to divert all the sap from
it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15804src" href="#xd31e15804">11</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—This is not the place to criticise the theory of imitation in general, with which
Professor Tarde thinks that we can explain every social phenomenon. In my opinion,
this theory, in so far as it is new is not correct, and in so far as it is correct
is not new. It is true as explaining how a social phenomenon, having taken its rise
in a locality, has been rapidly propagated, or why it still persists when the original
causes have ceased to operate.
</p>
<p>However, it is plain that by means of imitation one can give but a partial explanation
of the phenomena mentioned. Other factors must be pointed out to explain, for example,
why something spreads everywhere in consequence of imitation, at a certain moment,
while before it passed unperceived, etc.
</p>
<p>I agree, then, that the significance of imitation and tradition is very important
in explaining social phenomena, but I am of the opinion that imitation and tradition
represent the <i>conservative</i> element, and give us no information with regard to the birth of <i>new</i> social phenomena.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15818src" href="#xd31e15818">12</a>
</p>
<p>In the domain of criminality also imitation plays a great part. Children brought up
in a vicious environment, easily contract bad habits by imitation; the harmful influence
of prison is proverbial; a sensational crime often leads to analogous crimes. It is
also by imitation that we can explain, in part at least, the existence of the Mafia
and the Camorra, of which Professor Lombroso says, among other things: “The long persistence
and obstinacy of such associations as the Mafia, the Camorra, and brigandage, seem
to proceed in the first place from the antiquity of their existence, for the long
repetition of the same acts transforms them into a habit, and consequently into a
law. History teaches us that ethnic phenomena of long duration are not to be eradicated
easily at a stroke.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15842src" href="#xd31e15842">13</a>
</p>
<p>Since the phenomena named remain permanent, there must be other important social factors
which have nothing to do with imitation. Thus, for example, faith, whose prevalence
is based to a great extent upon tradition, would have disappeared long since, notwithstanding
<span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>tradition, if there had been no factors in the present society to make it persist.
</p>
<p>Admitting what has gone before, there is no reason to see in most of the examples
cited by the author in support of his theory, anything else than his great knowledge
of historic details of little or no importance for the question of criminality. Where,
for example, is the connection between the minstrels of the Middle Ages and the vagrants
of our own days? There is certainly none but this, that both went from place to place.
But even if there had never been wandering minstrels, the social phenomenon called
“vagrancy” would have existed all the same. It has nothing to do with imitation, but
on the contrary has everything to do with the existing social organization. It could
thus be proved by many examples that Professor Tarde exaggerates the extent of the
influence of imitation. We must not lose sight of the fact that imitation teaches
us nothing of the essential causes of a social phenomenon. When we seek the causes
of a disease that some one has, we frequently see that it is the result of a contagion;
we know, then, that the disease is contagious, and this knowledge will point out precautions
to be taken to limit or prevent the spread of the disease; but as to the causes of
the disease itself we still know nothing.
</p>
<p>It is the same way with regard to crime. It is certain that immoral ideas and customs
are easily contracted by children. The removal of children from a harmful environment
is therefore a preventive of the extension of crime. But we are still ignorant of
everything that concerns the rise of these immoral ideas and customs, which is, however,
the essential thing.
</p>
<p>With regard to the remarks of the author upon the influence of labor, wealth, poverty,
and civilization, I simply observe that these very important and very complicated
questions occupy but a few pages in his work. It will be, then, quite superfluous
to note in detail how the whole has been treated in a very incomplete manner, although
very true remarks are found there (for example, those upon the bad distribution of
labor, upon the desire for wealth as a cause of crime, etc.).—
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Beside an article that appeared in the “<span lang="fr">Revue Philosophique</span>” (1890), entitled “<span lang="fr">Misère et criminalité</span>”, Professor Tarde has taken up his subject again in a report: “<span lang="fr">La criminalité et les phénomènes économiques</span>” (Fifth Congress of Criminal Anthropology at Amsterdam). Of this report we give a
synopsis.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to Professor Tarde, since it has been recognized that the social factors
of criminality are the most important, there has been a manifest tendency to exaggerate
the importance of economic factors. Their high importance, which is incontestable,
does not at all justify our forgetting the stronger and more decisive action of the
beliefs and feelings in the aberrations of the will. Which of the two sources of criminality
is the more important, the economic or the religious (or intellectual)? That cannot
be decided. But it is much more important to know in what phases, from what sides
the economic life is criminogenous.
</p>
<p>Each economic phase, as, for example, domestic economy or urban economy, has its special
form of criminality. But political and religious changes, whether they correspond
or not to the transformations in the mode of production, have, perhaps, a much greater
part in criminality than have the economic transformations. The domestic economy,
for example, gives rise to different crimes in which no economic factor comes into
play; as uxoricide, for example.
</p>
<p>Neither poverty alone nor wealth alone is an obstacle to honesty. Poor peoples or
classes, accustomed to poverty, are often very honest, nor is there any more need
that great differences of wealth should lead to crime. But it is the abrupt passing
from wealth to poverty and from poverty to wealth that is dangerous to morality.
</p>
<p>“In short, criminality and morality are less dependent upon the economic <i>state</i> of a country, than upon its economic <i>transformations</i>. It is not capitalism as such that is demoralizing, it is the moral crisis that accompanies
the passage from artisan production to capitalistic production, or from some particular
mode of the latter to some other mode.
</p>
<p>“Economic phenomena may be regarded from three points of view: first, from the point
of view of their repetition, which has to do chiefly with the propagation of habits
of consumption, called <i>needs</i>, and of the corresponding habits of labor; second, from the point of view of their
opposition, which includes principally the contests of producers among themselves
by acute or chronic competition, during strikes, or crises of overproduction,—or contests
of consumers among themselves, through sumptuary laws, aristocratic or democratic,
or monopolies of consumption over which they dispute in a thousand ways, in time of
famine, or scarcity, or any form of <i>underproduction</i>,—or contests of producers with consumers, through their attempts to exploit one another,
monopolize prices, or laws regulating the maximum price, municipal tariffs, or protectionist
rights, etc.; <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>third, finally from the point of view of their adaptation, always being renewed and
always incomplete, which embraces the series of successful inventions, fortunate associations
of ideas from which proceed all fruitful associations of men, from the division of
labor and of commerce, an association spontaneous and implicit, to industrial, commercial,
financial, and syndical societies, etc.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15885src" href="#xd31e15885">14</a>
</p>
<p>It is through the second aspect that the economic life can give a direct explanation
of crime; that which is given by the other two is only an indirect explanation. That
is to say, each invention gives rise to a contest among producers, and the progress
of manufacturing creates the possibility of satisfying needs, but at the same time
makes those who for want of the means cannot satisfy them, feel their needs all the
more strongly.
</p>
<p>Every individual must satisfy a certain number of needs which have their marked recurrences.
A peaceful and honest society will be one in which the great majority of the persons
who compose it have, in measure, the means of satisfying these needs. “Regular habits
of consumption and production form the first condition for good moral health whether
individual or collective, just as regular digestion is the foundation of good physical
health. Those who are irregular become easily the ‘<span lang="fr">déclassés</span>.’ Nothing is more contagious than disorder.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15897src" href="#xd31e15897">15</a>
</p>
<p>Hence, then, comes the importance for criminality of social crises, since during these
production and consumption are deranged.
</p>
<p>According to Professor Tarde, the <i>social contradictions</i>, which are the <i>chronic crises</i> of societies, can be the sole causes of criminality. If a society succeeds in avoiding
every internal contradiction there can hardly be any further question of crime.
</p>
<p>Our opinions can always harmonize with those of the people around us, while we are
foreign to them in desire and feeling. “The criminal is he who, undergoing conformity
to the ideas of the community in which he lives, yet escapes from conforming to the
feelings and acts of the community. He acts contrary to his own principles, which
are those of society.” “It is, then, not to a social crisis that we must mount, but
to a psychological crisis that we must descend, to explain crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15910src" href="#xd31e15910">16</a>
</p>
<p>Social crises are of two kinds: politico-religious, and economic. In opposition to
divers statisticians, who are of the opinion that the former class cause a diminution
in criminality, the author thinks that this diminution is only apparent, and that
in reality the number <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>of crimes increases at these times; which is shown, for example, for France by the
addition of cases not prosecuted to those prosecuted.
</p>
<p>As to the effect of economic crises, statisticians, Professor Tarde claims, have not
yet examined it. It seems to him that there is no parallelism between economic crises
and criminality.
</p>
<p>The struggle of classes, which springs up and grows during the periods of crisis,
is a great danger to public morals, since it gives rise to a class spirit, and consequently
increases the contempt for the rights of individuals of another class. However, the
class struggle does not increase the number of individual crimes, but only the number
of collective crimes.
</p>
<p>To sum up, Professor Tarde is of the opinion, then, that social crises in general,
and economic crises in particular, are not the only source nor a continual source
of crime. The question of what is the cause of economic crises remains unexplained.
To solve this we must call in all political economy. The causes of these economic
crises are in brief: first, unlimited competition; second, unforeseen disasters. “We
may add that these acute conflicts lead to suicide more than to crime; they are a
factor of crime much less important than the sullen conflicts, the low but continuous
fevers of troubled epochs in quest of a stable state. And these are then less the
conflicts of production with itself, or of production with consumption, than the conflicts
of consumption with itself, <i>i.e.</i> the conflicts of needs that have grown but cannot be satisfied at the time, within
the limits of the always insufficient wages or profits, a fertile source of criminal
suggestions. When labor no longer suffices to satisfy the legitimate needs in accordance
with the prevailing standards, the desire of gain without labor invades the heart
and becomes general. The only remedy for this danger would be the advancement of manufacturing
and its reorganization upon a vaster and better conceived plan than the present one,
if, at the same time that any industrial progress gave more wealth for less labor,
it did not give rise to still more new wants. The individual organization of wants,
their <i>hierarchization</i>, by virtue of a certain unanimity of fundamental principles, must precede the social
organization of labor, if we wish this latter really to make for peace and morals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15926src" href="#xd31e15926">17</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—Professor Tarde’s report is characterized by many very true observations (as, for
example, that every economic phase has its own form of criminality; that sudden transitions
from wealth to poverty, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>vice versa, are morally more dangerous than slow changes; etc., etc.), but at the
same time is still more marked by a certain elasticity and lack of close reasoning.
Hence it is almost impossible to frame a criticism of the report that will follow
it step by step.
</p>
<p>However there are some things to be noted. According to the author there are two sources
of criminality, the one economic, the other intellectual. I consider that this distinction
is not correct. Every crime has an intellectual source, in this sense, that it is
an act conceived by the intellect. It is impossible, therefore, to see beside this
source an economic cause. But the intellect considered by itself is empty; it is from
the environment that it must draw the material which it will transform into ideas.
Consequently the question becomes this: how far is the economic environment the cause
of the formation of criminal thoughts. Intellect and economic conditions do not stand
side by side but the one follows upon the other. It is only making use of a commonplace
to say that crime has an intellectual source; that explains nothing.
</p>
<p>In reading the first pages of the report one expects, after the historical exposition
which says that every economic phase has its own form of criminality, to find an exposition
of the present economic system, and an inquiry into how far the criminality of our
own day is bound up with it. This would have been, I think, most important, and would
have advanced the subject. The most serious criticism that I have to make is that
nothing of the kind is attempted. What follows is only a series of isolated remarks,
which are correct only in part, and in which the whole question is reduced to a matter
of economic <i>crises</i>, although the title speaks of economic <i>conditions</i>.
</p>
<p>It is incorrect to say that the statisticians have not investigated the influence
of economic crises, as the second chapter of this work proves. In it I have analyzed
the works of the different authors who have especially treated of this subject. Finally,
I would call attention to the fact that he furnishes no proof of his assertion that
the class struggle takes its rise in times of crisis—and would find it difficult to
do so.
</p>
<p>What Professor Tarde means in speaking of “the advancement of manufacturing and its
reorganization upon a vaster and better conceived plan”, is not clear. But it is certain
that the final observation that there must be “an individual organization of wants”,
is purely Utopian. For it is one of the characteristic phenomena of our present society
that it has strongly excited the cupidity of men, and that this will disappear only
when its cause has ceased to exist.
</p>
<p>All Professor Tarde’s works upon criminality convince us of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>great knowledge of their author. The report of which I have been speaking contains
also ideas that are often very original, but this does not prevent the necessity of
confessing that it does not contribute much to the solution of the problem that it
treats.—

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">A. Corre.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the third book of his “<span lang="fr">Crime et <span class="corr" id="xd31e15958" title="Source: Suicide">suicide</span></span>” the author treats of the influence of economic conditions upon criminality, beginning
with “labor, wages, and needs.”
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p161width"><img src="images/p161.png" alt="Graph showing misdemeanors, crimes, and the price of bread over the period 1843–1883." width="475" height="512"></div><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Corre notes first the true condition of the free workman. No one is obliged to
give him work or bread, and it is forbidden to beg <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>or even to be idle. “There is no opinion more monstrous, more revolting, and more
cowardly. It is a social crime as well as the most dangerous of follies. For it is
necessary to be logical. If you oblige a man under all circumstances to live by his
own means, in the midst of a limited circle, where the places are distributed in advance,
the land divided to the smallest fragments, if you refuse him the right to alms after
having refused him work … you drive him to suicide or crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15968src" href="#xd31e15968">18</a> We must give work to everyone who wants to work, in order that he may support himself
and his family, and help must be given to those to whom work cannot be given, as in
the case of workmen not longer able to work because of sickness or old age. On the
other hand idleness must be punished as well as professional crime. Wages must be
so high that they are sufficient not only for the strict necessities, but for others
as well; for example, for a progressive education, without, however, arousing in the
laboring class the desire for luxury that always corrupts morals. Though naming a
single exception, Dr. Corre is of the opinion that wages are in general very insufficient,
especially if we take into account the fact that there are times of unemployment,
sickness, etc., during which nothing is earned. The question of wages is one of great
importance, then, for the etiology of criminality. Nevertheless all the improvement
of the material condition of the working class will accomplish nothing unless there
is at the same time a moral improvement.
</p>
<p>As other authors have already proved, the price of bread also has an influence upon
the course of criminality.
</p>
<p>Under the heading “economic conditions”, he calls attention, in the second place to
“assistance, savings, property.” When we study the effect of charity upon criminality
in the departments of France, we see that mendicity and vagrancy decrease, and that
crimes are only of moderate frequency, in places where the official assistance given
is the smallest, while criminality is pretty prevalent and even on the increase where
the greatest amount of official assistance is given. “Thus very limited assistance
will do less harm than if it were more extensive. Such is the interpretation the mind
gathers from a comparison of the economic and judicial statistics. Excess in alms-giving,
with difficulty separable from a bad distribution of wealth, will therefore have a
demoralizing influence; it enervates and sterilizes, and its fruits would appear more
bitter if it were possible to unveil the little secrets of assistance under the thousand
forms that it wears.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15974src" href="#xd31e15974">19</a>
</p>
<p>“Saving enlarges the field of the needs of the laborer, gives him <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>security for the future, strengthens his independence with regard to the state, and
his dignity in his relations with other citizens; it permits him to surround his family
with a greater degree of comfort, and through education to raise his children into
the professional hierarchy. It is therefore useful, and has a moralizing influence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15981src" href="#xd31e15981">20</a>
</p>
<p>However, exaggerated saving is very prejudicial to morality for it degenerates into
avarice and thus becomes the cause of crime. We often find the average number of depositors
in savings-banks in the departments that gave the lowest figure for crime. The departments
with a number of depositors above or below this average are apt to have high figures
for crime.
</p>
<p>“It is possible to criticise academically the famous saying of Proudhon, ‘property
is theft.’ To refute it will be at times difficult. I do not mean to say that all
property is theft, but I maintain that property in a measure that can be fixed is
nothing else. As it is organized with use, it is often immoral and one of the most
active factors in anti-social crime, latent or actual.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15987src" href="#xd31e15987">21</a> According to the author, one who owns property is a supporter of the state. For this
reason the number of small proprietors ought to be increased, even if this is possible
only by dividing great estates, which, however, have almost always been gotten together
by immoral means, by pillaging, by paying very small wages in manufacturing, by gambling,
etc. “They are all, in the first instance, the fruit of a skill and a want of scruple
which would never obtain the sanction of a really equitable society; at their blaze,
which scorns poverty, the passion for gain is kindled, and dull rage begins to develop
the germ of reprisals. How shall we make men who have nothing, and exhaust themselves
to gain the bare necessaries of life, satisfied that the persons who do no work and
only amuse themselves possess everything? You may talk of legal limitations as much
as you like, but conscience will revolt against a doctrine that makes stolen property
sacred after a certain period of impunity, and leads to the cynical conclusion that
any article or piece of land, acquired by crime, is the legitimate possession of the
bandit if during 5, 10, 20, 30 years he succeeds in warding off the attacks of the
law.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15990src" href="#xd31e15990">22</a> Not only has property often been acquired in an illegal manner, but the transmission
of it is also immoral. For it is by this means that persons have acquired great fortunes
which they would never have earned by their labor. It would be preferable to make
private fortunes accrue to the state, after provision had been made for the widow
and children “to provide for the needs of persons who <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>are useful but made unproductive by poverty, and to reënforce the collective labor.”
In this way a general prosperity would replace great fortunes; this would increase
the feeling of solidarity, while great fortunes only awaken cupidity and lead to the
commission of crimes. The richest departments give the highest figures for criminality.
By the suppression or limitation of inheritance we should suppress also the numerous
crimes against life resulting from it.
</p>
<p>In the sixth chapter, in which Dr. Corre examines the relative importance of the principal
sociological factors, he sums up his opinion as to the influence of economic conditions
upon criminality. Too great wealth and too great poverty are both causes of crime.
“The first corrupts and the second degrades; both lead to crime through lessening
the resistance to temptation that promises the satisfaction of wants fictitious or
real, and when they both appear in the same environment, they give more energy to
bad impulses, more violence to conflicts.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15997src" href="#xd31e15997">23</a> This is why the agricultural class, in which moderate prosperity prevails, is the
least criminal. The means by which this condition of things is to be improved is complex:
“it is not altogether to be found in the solution of the question of wages; it is
chiefly to be found in a better system for making the masses moral, in the reduction
of the influences which tempt them to improvidence and idleness, lead them to drunkenness
and alcoholism.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16000src" href="#xd31e16000">24</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—The second part of this work will show sufficiently why, in my opinion, the treatment
of Dr. Corre is confused and incomplete, notwithstanding the truth of some observations
made by him with regard to the subject which concerns us. The criticism of the author
upon the organization of society at present is that of the petty bourgeoisie; he expects
salvation only from the multiplication of small holdings, and hopes that this will
make mankind happier. However, the development of large industries makes me believe
that this hope will never be realized.—

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">L. Manouvrier.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the adherents of the “hypothesis of the environment,” Professor Manouvrier
is undoubtedly the one who has set forth this doctrine in the clearest manner. Being
an anthropologist it is evident that he has not given his attention more especially
to economic conditions. <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>But it seems to me that what he says in opposition to the theory of Professor Lombroso,
and in support of that of the environment, is of the greatest importance. I will give
a résumé, therefore, of his “<span lang="fr">Genèse normale du crime</span>”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16020src" href="#xd31e16020">25</a> and in doing so will quote his own words as far as possible, in order to give their
full value. Although there is no connection between the doctrine of Professor Lombroso
and his adherents, and this work, I shall be forced to follow his whole demonstration,
because of the interlacing of the theories of the Italian school and the detailed
exposition of the doctrine of the “environment.”
</p>
<p>The doctrine of the innate character of crime and the phrenology of Gall and Spurzheim
are closely connected. Gall thought that he had discovered in the brain the organs
of homicide and theft, without, however, denying the importance of surroundings, so
that he explained a case of theft by means of circumstances when the bump of theft
was wanting in the thief.
</p>
<p>This doctrine has been entirely supplanted by the theories of Lamarck and Darwin.
“In the place of attributing to the environment the rôle of a simple player of a hand-organ,
Lamarck sees in it a true musician playing upon his instrument any airs suited to
its complexity and qualities. Further, the quality and characteristics of the instrument
can be modified, transformed under the influence of this marvelous musician and that
of the music executed. This was the ruin of craniomancy. The diagnostics of phrenology
found themselves limited at once and for always to the faculties, the elementary dispositions
that Gall and Spurzheim had tried in vain to discover, and which are consistent with
the execution of acts indefinitely variable.
</p>
<p>“The phrenologists are right in connecting the ‘properties of the soul and mind’ with
organization, but they are wrong in connecting such acts as theft and homicide with
organic causes, as if these acts had the value of real, irreducible functions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16036src" href="#xd31e16036">26</a>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the bond between phrenology and the positivist school, this school
does not rely upon the theory in question, but upon the transformist theory, <i>i.e.</i> upon the theory that gives its attention to environment. The cause of this is that
the fundamental error that forms the point of departure is still universally prevalent.
“This error consists in believing that acts sociologically defined, like crimes, <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>can be connected with the anatomical conformation, without being first referred by
a psychological analysis to their psychological elements, the only ones, whether normal
or pathological, that depend directly upon anatomy. The same error consists in confusing
the combinations of aptitudes formed under the influence of environment, with the
elementary aptitudes resulting from the native organization or its successive modifications.
It also leads to a misunderstanding of the primary fact that two individuals similarly
constituted can be led, in consequence of the influence of dissimilar environments
to which they have been subjected since their birth, to conduct themselves in different,
and even quite opposite, ways, without their acts ceasing to be, on that account,
conformed to their anatomical constitution.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16045src" href="#xd31e16045">27</a>
</p>
<p>It is a fact well known to biologists that in all living beings qualities often occur
that did not appear in their immediate forebears but in more remote generations. This
reappearance of qualities is called atavism. Its importance has been too much exaggerated,
however, and it has been made into a magic word with which, it has been thought, everything
could be explained, including crime. The line of reasoning has been as follows: crime
is one of the ordinary phenomena among savage peoples, and must therefore have been
so among the ancestors of the civilized peoples. It is observed that among the criminals
of our day there are more of the anatomical stigmata indicating atavism than among
non-criminals; consequently crime is a phenomenon of atavism! There are numerous errors
in this reasoning. “Since we are treating the question of crime, we must first of
all know what is understood by crime, must give a definition of it indicating what
crime corresponds to physiologically, and to what order of anatomical characteristics
the physiological tendency to crime corresponds. Considered in themselves, these acts
suppose only the existence of a conformation permitting, and of needs demanding, their
accomplishment. If such a conformation and such needs no longer exist in the normal
state among civilized peoples, where nevertheless the acts are frequent, it would
be proper to examine the authors of them for abnormal characteristics; not merely
<i>any</i> abnormal characteristics, but characteristics, anatomical or physiological, that
it would be possible to connect with these aptitudes and needs that have become abnormal.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16052src" href="#xd31e16052">28</a>
</p>
<p>Among the anatomical stigmata observed in criminals in prison there are several which,
considered by themselves, have nothing <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>abnormal about them; none of them would serve to characterize criminals. We often
find, for example, that murderers have relatively large jaws, which are ordinarily
thus an index of a conformation disposed to brutality; “but this brutality is absolutely
of the same order as that of men compared with women; it is a masculine characteristic,
and the masculine conformation is indubitably favorable to crimes of violence much
more than the feminine; but happily it happens that most men, in civilized countries,
live under conditions in which their natural brutality does not prevent their being
very peaceable citizens, though it would be imprudent to molest them. Very vigorous
men are ordinarily endowed with square and very solid jaws; they are men for attack
or defense, who may be very useful to society or very harmful, as the case may be.
Given to acting vigorously and brutally, this they may be, but inclined to crime they
are not, any more than the men with small jaws, whose mildness is often the effect
of muscular weakness, and who, though little given to striking and breaking down doors,
nevertheless know how to be brutal and violent in their own way.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16059src" href="#xd31e16059">29</a>
</p>
<p>However, it might be thought that these anatomical characteristics, though not dangerous
in themselves, are nevertheless an indication of a tendency on their part to act like
savages. But this is not the case; these characteristics “are morphological accidents
that are purely local and are compatible with the most fortunate conformation.” But
this is not saying that every peculiarity must remain unutilized. Thus, for example,
there are persons who are able to move their ears. “If murder and theft were acts
as little complicated, and of as little importance as moving the ears, and if these
acts, having become criminal, did not suppose very complex anatomical and psychological
coördinations; if there were, in other words, as Gall supposed, cerebral organs specially
and innately fitted for murder and theft, we could believe that the mere atavistic
presence of these organs would constitute a tendency to commit these crimes; but neither
anatomo-physiological analysis, nor psychology will justify today so simple a conception.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16064src" href="#xd31e16064">30</a>
</p>
<p>And then it has not been proved that murder and theft were habitual with our ancestors;
they had recourse to them only under stress of circumstances, quite like any normal
man of today. Considered from an anatomical point of view our means of injuring our
fellows have decreased; on the other hand we have now other means at our disposal
(firearms, etc.). “As to the need of pleasure and of <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>life, this can only have increased, and never can cupidity have been more aroused
than in our civilized society. Never have the temptations to appropriate the goods
of others been stronger and more frequent. Civilization tends to develop wants and
appetites, whence there comes this colossal extension of the means of repression and
of coercion employed to make criminal attempts dangerous, in order that crime may
not be too easy a means of acquiring fortune. Except for purely pathological cases,
the criminal is moved by his wants, by wants that have nothing extraordinary about
them; when a man has an interest, or thinks he has an interest in committing a crime,
he brings into play muscular and cerebral aptitudes which every normal man possesses,
the same elementary aptitudes as those he might have made use of, under other circumstances,
to pursue and punish a criminal.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16071src" href="#xd31e16071">31</a>
</p>
<p>Some biological facts are to be explained by atavism; their explanation nevertheless
remains mysterious. But atavism loses all its importance as a means of explanation
as soon as we know how to explain a fact by actually existing causes, as is the case
with crime. “We should understand that it would be a question of atavistic tendencies
if assassins killed for the sole pleasure of killing, if thieves stole for the pleasure
of stealing. Now we know well that theft and murder are only means, and that their
use is called ‘work’ by professional criminals. If they prefer this kind of work it
is because it is quicker and less painful than regular work.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16077src" href="#xd31e16077">32</a>
</p>
<p>It might be objected here that the horror of blood being natural to most men it would
be necessary just the same to have recourse to atavism to explain murder. This horror
of blood is assuredly found in most men, but only so far as their interest requires.
Not a single surgeon or butcher pursues his bloody trade through atavism, but only
because forced to it by his interests. More than one born-bourgeois thinks that he
would never eat meat rather than have to kill cattle himself, but this is only pure
illusion or an unconscious hypocrisy. For he would do it without any doubt if he could
not gain his livelihood in any other way. Do not the bourgeoisie shoot their inoffensive
fellow citizens who revolt against a social condition that no one would dare to call
ideal? Do they not mow down savages with machine guns in order to divide up their
country? Or do they not make war against other states in order to protect their own
commercial interests? It will be objected that these things are not crimes; this is
a question of definition, but assuredly they are similar to crime.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>“It is not only in the prisons that we find born-criminals; but we are all such, if
we understand by this abusive expression the possession of hereditary tendencies to
enjoy things ourselves, in case of need, to the detriment of our fellows. The human
crimes to which I have just alluded indicate chiefly the cruelty and ferocity of the
species, and of ethnic collectivities, social or otherwise. As to the individual equivalents
of crime, I will recall further that they are not difficult to discover in the conduct
of honest men, most of whom do not trouble themselves to make use of means as harmful
and immoral as those which criminals do. The equivalents of crime among honest men
present, it is true, the great advantage of remaining more or less unperceived by
the penal code, by the police at least, and the psychologists of the New School; but
they are nevertheless recognized as immoral and harmful by those who have recourse
to them, and they suffice to show in what way honest men would conduct themselves
if the conditions in which they live and have lived had not driven them away from
crime, legally so-called, with as much force as the opposite environmental conditions
have driven others to it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16085src" href="#xd31e16085">33</a>
</p>
<p>Having made fuller remarks to the effect that the cruel and repugnant professions
referred to above are not practiced because of atavistic tendencies, but solely from
necessity, the author ends this part of his article as follows: “There nevertheless
remains a tremendous difference between the killing of an animal and the killing of
a man, from a moral point of view, of course, but also from the point of view of the
motives generally fitted to prevent the killing. But it must be remarked that these
motives are connected with environmental influences which are exceedingly variable,
and which, for too many persons, are considerably diminished and at the same time
replaced by influences of the opposite environment. Most assassins have received a
certain <i>culture</i> appropriate to the conception of murder and to its realization, and this is simply
facilitated by their conformation, which is in no wise exceptional. If we had only
to twirl our thumb to get rid of an enemy we should have to put forth all our efforts
to harm no one. Already too many respectable men can order murders that they would
not be courageous enough to execute. Let us congratulate ourselves that self-interest
more often deters men from murder than drives them to it, for every normal man possesses
the cerebral and muscular qualities necessary to conceive, prepare, and execute the
crime. It is not necessary to call in the return to animal instincts through atavism.
The continuity of man and the animals is much <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>more perfect than the atavistic school pretends. Man is always an animal; the most
dangerous of all because he is the most intelligent and because he can utilize his
faculties in all sorts of ways, harmful or useful to his fellows according to his
own interest. The formula to be applied is to arrange things so that every man will
find more advantage in being useful to his fellows than in injuring them. Progress
in this regard would be more rapid without this unfortunate predilection for occult
causes, which leads so many excellent minds to seek in the clouds for explanations
that lie under their noses, but which have to be found just where they are.
</p>
<p>“Those ferocious instincts which seem the return of another world, in brawls or in
times of revolution, are not returning at all, because they have never disappeared.
During a certain time they do not manifest themselves in the individual or the family,
because there is no need that they should; or possibly they manifest themselves in
ways less dangerous, in connection with ordinary circumstances and relatively favorable
to tranquillity. But let there arise any need, no matter what, of a “mobilization
of the offensive and defensive forces”, then the mobilization takes place, and the
most civilized man appears under the form of the dangerous animal he has never ceased
to be, happily for himself and his species. This man whom you take for an atavistic
throw-back, appears such to you only because you have failed to recognize in their
mild form, in yourself and in others, the fundamental brutality and egoism of the
human species. Notwithstanding the civilizing influences in the midst of which you
have lived, notwithstanding the peaceable habits that you have contracted, and all
the horror with which you are inspired by the contrary habits of which you fear to
fall the victim, it is enough that you should be worked upon rather strongly by a
combination of annoying circumstances, that even you should become a dangerous individual.
When we wish to study crime as anthropologists or as psychologists, we must not be
afraid to look the truth in the face, and it is important to clear our minds beforehand,
as far as possible, of the illusions of self-love, and of deceptive conventions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16096src" href="#xd31e16096">34</a>
</p>
<p>Then Professor Manouvrier criticises in a manner as just as it is witty, the hypothesis
of the “delinquent man.” He demonstrates that, according to the method of the New
School, a work could be written upon the “hunting man” also, full of scientific observations
upon his argot, his boasting, etc., etc., upon all sorts of signs, in short, which
go to show that a taste for hunting is an atavistic phenomenon. <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>The explanation of crime by atavism is no more true than this other, for both can
be explained by the environment.
</p>
<p>If we hold absolutely to the expression: “born-criminal”, every man is one, just as
every dog is a born-swimmer. Every dog knows how to swim very well, but this does
not prevent a number of dogs from never swimming, since ordinarily there are more
convenient ways of crossing the water. In the same way every man is a born-criminal,
but most men refrain from becoming actual criminals, since that course is more advantageous
to them than the other.
</p>
<p>“No one is ignorant that the educational influences to which one is subjected during
his whole life and especially during infancy, and the solicitations of self-interest,
are exceedingly variable under different circumstances and for different individuals;
and that the educational influences and the solicitations of self-interest unite very
generally to furnish the motive for criminal conduct and for honest conduct as well.
And it is this that governs every man’s manner of acting in his relations with others;
and it must not be forgotten in treating of anthropology, whether anatomical, physio-psychological,
or sociological. It is never forgotten in practical life.
</p>
<p>“We all know that, whatever our fundamental character may be and the honest habits
that we have been able to form, our manner of conducting ourselves may vary considerably
under the influence of changes in our environment, and in proportion to those changes.
It is a temptation to which the most austere man would greatly dread to be exposed,
and to which he would never voluntarily expose himself, because he knows that the
tendencies imputed to criminals (said to be atavistic, but all simply human) are not
lacking in himself. These tendencies, when they have found abundant and honorable
means of satisfaction during long years, become so much the more to be dreaded on
this account, and run great danger of becoming criminal as soon the legal means of
satisfaction disappear. The man who comes to lack these means finds himself in a much
more dangerous situation as far as the likelihood of his becoming a criminal is concerned,
than one who had become accustomed to privations.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16107src" href="#xd31e16107">35</a>
</p>
<p>Professor Manouvrier begins the last section of his study by asking what is the significance
of the anatomical peculiarities observed in the so-called born-criminals. “The truth
probably is that we do find in a number of criminals in prison more of the lower or
abnormal characteristics than in a like number of persons chosen at random. But this
<span class="corr" id="xd31e16112" title="Source: is">in</span> no wise proves that those among the criminals who have such <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>characteristics, have been predestined to crime from their physical make-up. Those
among them who are not so constituted are nevertheless criminals, and honest men who
bear the criminal marks have nevertheless remained honest.
</p>
<p>“The truth is that the ‘new school’ consider as criminals only the refuse of this
class, the prisoners; just as, when they wanted to depict prostitutes, they took poor
syphilitic girls who had been at least three years in brothels, that is to say, the
refuse of refuse. Under what family and social conditions these criminals and prostitutes
lived during childhood and afterward, it is easy for anyone to imagine who has caught
but a glimpse of the slums of manufacturing towns. In order to escape crime and prostitution
or mendicity when one has grown up in such an environment, it is necessary to have
virtues that are extremely rare among respectable people, so much the more so since,
to the temptations that come from poverty in the midst of luxury, is ordinarily added
the effect of example, and even of education of the particular kind that is called
criminal education. All this may be resisted for some time, but it is only the first
step that costs. The good qualities themselves that one possesses become the causes
of crime. It may even be maintained that physical excellencies themselves drive men
to crime more strongly than defects, when once the external conditions become favorable
for crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16119src" href="#xd31e16119">36</a>
</p>
<p>The fact that we generally find more inferior individuals among the criminals imprisoned
than among other men must be attributed to the two following circumstances: first,
that criminals who have not been arrested, owe their liberty generally to the fact
that they are better endowed; and second, that in all social classes a selection goes
on by which those best constituted are always in possession of the most desirable
and least painful means of existence, while to those less privileged fall the lowest
professions, and they “end sooner or later by falling into the ditch where the influences
that drive men to crime reach their maximum frequency and power, while the contrary
motives are proportionately weak.” Those who have known better days sometimes prefer
suicide to crime; but those who are born in the ditch, know no other life, and are
consequently led into crime.
</p>
<p>What is much more astonishing than crime is the fact that workmen labor courageously
and patiently for ten or twelve hours a day, and notwithstanding this lead only a
miserable life. The reason is that they have known nothing but labor since infancy
and have always <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>had to be content with very simple amusements. It goes without saying that one man
is more moved to commit crimes than another, although the conditions under which they
are living are the same, just as an athlete will use violence quicker than a weakling.
But this is no reason to declare strength a factor of crime, since it serves for useful
acts as well. Acts which are contrary to the proper working of society are, therefore,
called abnormal and those are called normal that are in harmony with it. But it is
not therefore permissible to transfer this distinction to the field of biology, and
call the criminal abnormal. “Aptitudes that are very normal physiologically, may be
employed for acts that are equally normal physiologically, but which, from a social
point of view are classed as abnormal, because contrary to the social prosperity.
Yet this is an abuse of the word ‘abnormal’, because society as at present constituted
is, in its normal functioning, consistent with innumerable causes of conflict between
its own interests and those of individuals. And just as the annoying consequences
of our mistakes often make us recognize the truth, so crimes very often serve to indicate
to societies the reforms they ought to bring about in order to perfect themselves.
</p>
<p>“Every individual has wants to satisfy, wants primordial or secondary, that may become
infinitely complicated and clothed in forms as much more various as the environment
becomes more complex. Now it happens in every society, and especially in very civilized
societies, that the different individuals do not find the same facilities, and further,
do not possess the same means of action. There is an evident disproportion between
the existing needs and the milder means of satisfying them; whence the struggle for
existence and well-being.
</p>
<p>“In our estimating the intrinsic worth of criminals, we must not fail to take account
of this fact, that most honest men do not deprive themselves of any of the pleasures
which are the aim of criminals, and that most criminals, in order to escape crime
would have had to have rare virtue. Among the legal means of satisfaction offered
by society there are those that are easy and agreeable, among others that of drawing
the income from capital amassed by one’s parents. There are also difficult and painful
ones, which are the lot of those whom pecuniary heredity has not secured against the
so-called criminal heredity. In order to share legally in the pleasures of which they
are witnesses, those whom we may call disinherited by fortune, must make efforts of
which those born to wealth have no idea. This is why, if the disinherited seek a short-cut,
we must ask ourselves, <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>before we consider them as monstrous beings, whether under the same circumstances
we should be able to keep to the legal path.
</p>
<p>“The struggle for existence and well-being is regulated by social laws. If these were
perfect, each individual could satisfy his wants in an equitable measure, that is
to say in the measure of his faculties, his labor, and the service he renders to the
community. Crimes would then be diminished in an enormous proportion, but they would
not be suppressed, for there would still be inevitable competitions, and the time
will probably never come when, on the one hand, each individual will have just the
wants that his social worth will permit him to satisfy legally, and, on the other,
will have sufficient virtue to renounce the satisfaction of wants, even factitious
ones, which he has once contracted without being able to comply with the conditions
which the most just law imposes for this satisfaction.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16135src" href="#xd31e16135">37</a>
</p>
<p>The penal law is one of the means the object of which is combating the illegal satisfaction
of wants. Everyone knows, however, that this means does not always attain the end
sought. The penal law will, in fact, produce a diminution of criminality only when
it shall have brought about profound penal changes,—when punishment shall be no more
than the <i>useful and necessary reaction</i> against acts that are harmful to the well-being of the community and to the development
of society.
</p>
<p>It is to be proved that there is, besides the normal, or ordinary, origin of crime,
a pathological, or extraordinary, origin. “It is quite superfluous to bring in tendencies
atavistically recalled by pathological degeneracy, in order to explain the harmful
effects of this degeneracy, and of mental diseases, upon the way in which the degenerate
and mentally diseased act. The least functional trouble is enough to alter our sensations,
our judgment, our imagination, our deliberations, and consequently, to make us act
wrongly.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16144src" href="#xd31e16144">38</a>
</p>
<p>The theory of the innate character of crime through atavism is consequently quite
erroneous. “It would be unseemly on my part to refer it, through atavism, to <i>original sin</i> or to the <i>call of the blood</i> of the ancient melodramas. I will not even say that it is derived through tradition,
which is an environmental influence, from the old phrenological doctrine, although
that is an error of the same kind. Errors, in fact, are like crimes; they have no
need of atavism nor of immediate heredity, nor even of tradition, in order to repeat
themselves. Causes of error or causes of crime, the springs are far from being dried
up. They always flow abundantly. It is necessary in <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>science to react against errors, and in society to react against crimes. But it must
never be forgotten that every man is normally exposed to commit both errors and crimes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16155src" href="#xd31e16155">39</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—I shall make only a few observations upon Professor Manouvrier’s study, a work which,
in my opinion, is one of the best, not to say <i>the</i> best, upon the origin of crime, and in about fifty pages says more than many a bulky
volume.
</p>
<p>In the first place Professor Manouvrier shows that in our days wants have increased
greatly, and he believes that civilization is the cause of it. I am of the opinion
that this last assertion is not correct and that civilization has nothing to do with
it. Many writers commit this error of confusing civilization and the present mode
of production, and it is just for this reason that it is useful and necessary to correct
it. All the evils that have been brought upon the peoples of Africa and of China,
war, alcohol, etc., etc., have been called by the collective name of “civilization.”
In reality it is those who have brought all these calamities upon these countries,
and have tried to destroy a veritable, age-long civilization like that of China, who
are the barbarians. It is not a civilizing instinct that has driven European states
to a policy of expansion, but rather cupidity, eagerness for gain on the part of the
owning class, who are seeking a new outlet for their merchandise; in short, it is
the present mode of production, capitalism.
</p>
<p>The same is true with regard to the constant increase of wants; it is the present
system which <i>creates</i> wants. New methods of procuring profit are invented, and it is only with this in
view that many inventions are made, most of them useless, often even harmful. And
on the other hand there is a class of persons who grasp at any means, even the most
absurd, of passing the time, and have the money to procure these means. And these
wants spring up in other persons also, and the impossibility of satisfying them makes
men the more eager. Consequently it is not civilization, but capitalism, which must
be designated as the cause of this phenomenon.
</p>
<p>In the second place, Professor Manouvrier thinks that criminality would diminish enormously,
but without disappearing entirely, if the social laws were perfected so that each
individual could satisfy his wants according to his capacities, his labor, and his
services to the community. This is, in my opinion, entirely correct; but the maxim
of Saint-Simon, “to every man according to his capacities, to each <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>capacity according to its works”, which, in Professor Manouvrier’s opinion, is perfect,
by many others is not thought to be so, though superior to the present distribution
of commodities. We can set over against this the rule, “that each shall work according
to his faculties and his strength, and receive according to his needs.” If this were
realized, crime would become almost unimaginable. Many persons are of the opinion
that such a thing could never be realized. But they forget that it is exclusively
from the environment that the enormous differences in wants arise (the wife of the
millionaire has perhaps a thousand times as many needs as the wife of the proletarian).
If these two persons had been born and brought up in the same environment, the wants
of the one would have been to those of the other perhaps as 1 to 3, or even less,
but certainly not more. And then those who believe in a future distribution according
to needs, are of the opinion (and think they can prove it) that, if in the present
organization of society egoism is omnipotent, the feeling of solidarity will be so
strengthened in the future social organization, that the man endowed with great abilities
and much energy, will not begrudge his fellow less highly endowed, the satisfaction
of all his wants.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>I would, at the same time, make a remark concerning the environmental school in general,
a remark not to be considered as a criticism, for I agree perfectly that it is the
environment that makes the criminal. It is this: it is not enough for the treatment
of the question of criminality, to furnish proof of the assertion that the cause of
crime is not inherent in man; it is also necessary to show in what respects the environment
is criminogenous, and in what way it can be improved. Now the French School has given
but little attention to this.—

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The work of Dr. Baer, “<span lang="de">Der Verbrecher in anthropologischer Beziehung</span>”, has only an indirect importance for our subject, as the title indicates. Since
his medical and anthropological studies lead him to the conclusion that the social
atmosphere is the fundamental cause of crime, it is worth while to note his opinion.
For this it will be sufficient to quote the following: “For us crime is, as Prins
excellently expresses it, not an individual phenomenon, but a social one. ‘Criminality
is made up of the elements of human society itself, it is not transcendent but immanent.
We can see in it a kind of degeneration <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>of the social organism.… The criminal and the honest man are each dependent upon their
environment. There are social conditions that are favorable to moral health, where
there is no tendency, no inclination toward crime; there is a social environment where
the atmosphere is corrupt, where unwholesome elements have accumulated, where crime
settles as soot does in a flue, where the tendency toward crime bears fruit.’ Though
Ferri has recently advocated the opinion that the criminal is the result of three
factors, operative at the same time, and that these three causes are individual (<i>i.e.</i> anthropological), physical,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16192src" href="#xd31e16192">40</a> and social; in our opinion, on the other hand, these three causes are actually to
be reduced to a single one, if, as he himself points out, we take into consideration
the fact that the first two are both dependent upon social conditions. The anthropological
and physical stigmata of criminals are, as we have endeavored to show above, in most
cases wholly conditioned by the influences and circumstances of their environment.
</p>
<p>“Crime, we will close this work by saying, is not the consequence of a special organization
of the criminal, an organization which is peculiar to the criminal alone, and which
forces him to the commission of criminal acts. The criminal, such by habit and apparently
born as such, bears many marks of bodily and mental deformity, which have, however,
neither in their totality nor singly, so marked and peculiar a character as to differentiate
the criminal from his fellows as a distinct type. The criminal bears the traces of
degeneracy that are to be found in abundance among the lower classes from which he
mostly takes his rise. These traces, acquired through social conditions and transmitted,
in his case at times emerge in stronger form. Whoever would do away with crime must
do away with the social wrongs in which crime takes root and grows, and, in establishing
and applying forms of punishment, must give more weight to the individuality of the
criminal than to the category under which the crime falls.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16203src" href="#xd31e16203">41</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I cannot better give Professor Prins’s opinion upon the subject of my work than by
quoting what he says in his book, “<span lang="fr">Criminalité et répression</span>”, and especially in his first chapter entitled “<span lang="fr">De la criminalité en général. Des classes criminelles. Des délinquants d’accident
et des délinquants de profession</span>.” There we read: “There exists no abstract type of a moral man, nor of a guilty man;
crime is not an individual phenomenon, but a social phenomenon. Criminality proceeds
from the very elements of humanity itself; it is not transcendent, but immanent; we
can see in it a sort of degeneration of the social organism.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16273src" href="#xd31e16273">1</a>
</p>
<p>There is an environment favorable to moral health, where the tendency to crime is
almost wholly lacking; there is a social environment where the atmosphere is corrupt,
where unwholesome elements are heaped up, where the most vigorous perish, where criminality
spreads like the mould in the dunghill; the tendency toward crime there is formidable,
and we can say in this sense that it is a social fact with a social cause, and that
it is in intimate connection with a given social organization.
</p>
<p>Let us consider our own epoch for a moment. A century of progress and refinement is
a century of vices; the increasing complexity of our mechanism creates, with new temptations,
new occasions of falling. The car of civilization, like that of Juggernaut, destroys
many of those who throw themselves under its wheels. The world has enormous <span class="corr" id="xd31e16279" title="Source: appetities">appetites</span> that it cannot satisfy: sensuality, greed of gain, a taste for and facility in speculation;
the contrast between <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>great wealth and extreme poverty; the brutal necessities of the struggle for existence
in the face of the concentration of property and of capital; the defects of the industrial
organization, which abandons the proletariat to chance, keeps no watch over apprenticeship,
and leaves the child of the working-man to the excitations of the streets and the
promiscuity of the workshop, and finally sharpens everywhere the obscure instincts
of animalism; all this recoils upon criminality with deplorable certainty. How far
wrong we should be in such an environment simply to contrast the delinquent with the
honest man! It is two social states that are contrasted; the one is based upon comfortable
means, sociability, mutual protection, useful work, and thrift; the other upon poverty,
isolation, egoism, and unproductive labor. And in the great urban agglomerations,
pauperism, mendicity and vagrancy, idleness, the spirit of adventure, prostitution,
the dissipation of strength, everything, in short, naturally concurs in developing
social anemia.
</p>
<p>“Take any district whatsoever, however poor, uncivilized, and wild, and you will always
find in the great cities, London or Paris, New York or San Francisco, a worse environment
and greater depravity. It is here, in the lowest slums, where never a glimmer of physical
or moral well-being penetrates, that the disinherited live. They get a glimpse of
the splendor of luxury only to hate it; they respect neither property nor life, because
neither property nor life has any real value for them; they are born, grow pale, struggle,
and die, without suspecting that for certain persons existence is good fortune, property
a right, virtue a habit, and calm a constant state. Such is the natural and fatal
home of criminality.
</p>
<p>“In a quarter subjected to detestable hygiene, built upon marshy soil, devoid of drainage
and potable water, furrowed with narrow and filthy streets, covered with hovels without
life or air, where an atrophied population vegetates, epidemics are inevitable and
propagate themselves with great intensity. In the same way, crime finds an easy and
certain prey in the environment of the poor of a great city. The illegitimate and
abandoned children, the children of convicts and prostitutes, the vagrants, etc. are
so many designated recruits. Without family, without traditions, without fixed home
or settled occupation, without relations with the ruling classes, what wonder that
they have no other motive than complete egoism, no other activity than selfish and
transitory efforts for the immediate satisfaction of their material appetites? The
emigration from the country to the city still further increases this army and multiplies
the chances of <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>crime. When the sons of peasants leave the plow for the workshop and come to seek
fortune in the furnace of great cities, they follow the spirit of adventure; they
must have, at any price, a means of subsistence, and as competition is great and temptations
arise at every step, the prisons profit by this overplus that the country gives to
the city. Another consequence of the immigration from the country is that the population
becomes excessive, places are lacking, and wages fall below the living expenses. Ducpetiaux
showed, in 1856, that the budget of the working-man in the great cities is lower than
the sum representing the budget of the working-man in prison. This situation has not
changed, and the laboring class, badly lodged, badly nourished, vegetate at the mercy
of economic crises. The working-man is always on the verge of vagrancy, the vagrant
always on the verge of crime. The whole proletariat is thus exposed in the front rank,
and whether it is a question of sickness or crime, it is the first to fall.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16289src" href="#xd31e16289">2</a>
</p>
<p>“Such are the conditions of the development of the criminal classes, that is to say
of the classes where we meet the tendency to crime. And it is of importance to remark
that we can determine their legal character; they are the vagrants and delinquents
by profession. They are clearly differentiated from the vagabonds and delinquents
by accident. This distinction, which modern statistics has brought into relief, is
now the basis of penal science, and the judge can no longer overlook it.
</p>
<p>“The occasional delinquents constitute the minority, their life is regular, their
instincts are right; a sudden passion, an unpremeditated outburst, a passing depression
of the will, leads them into crime; a sort of fever dominates them and, the fit once
past, their normal life takes up its course again.
</p>
<p>“On the other hand, the professional delinquents, who make up the largest part of
the population of the prisons, are really the criminal class. They are the hardened,
the incorrigible, the recidivists. They form, by the side of regular society, the
great rebel tribe, where gather and mingle poverty, ignorance, vice, idleness, and
prostitution. The soldiers of this army obey, not a momentary desire, but a permanent
tendency. They do not always commit crime for crime’s sake, but the most trivial incident
drives them to it; they profit by every opportunity, and we can say that, as in certain
circles virtue is a reflex act, so crime is a reflex act with them. Further, they
have, quite like the civilized world, a public opinion which supports them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>arouses them, gives them their own kind of popularity, and constitutes, in a word,
an incentive for the heroes of vice, just as the other public opinion encourages the
soldiers of duty.
</p>
<p>“What is true of criminal society as a whole, is equally true of the individual as
such. In each infraction of the law, besides the accidental factor, <i>i.e.</i> age, character, temperament, in a word, the personal disposition, there is the collective
or social factor, <i>i.e.</i> the environment, the permanent conditions, the general laws. With the occasional
delinquent the individual factor predominates, it is especially the man that appears.
With the habitual delinquent, it is the social factor, the collectivity that comes
upon the scene.
</p>
<p>“In the well-to-do, polished, educated classes, who have lacked nothing and have had
the benefit of civilizing influences from the cradle, the fault is chiefly personal,
and<span></span> it is the exception. In the lower strata, where everything is lacking, where, to
combat evil, men have neither in the present, social protection, nor in the past,
the generations of ancestors who have enjoyed power, wealth, and education, it is
chiefly collective. In this sense, then, the collective forces have a dominant action
in criminality; in order to combat it these must be attacked, and the legislator finds
in the law only a blunted weapon if he does not understand this supreme truth, the
social character of criminality.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16309src" href="#xd31e16309">3</a>

<p class="first">The preface to “Crime and its Causes” contains an abridgment of the opinion of the
author upon the influence of economic conditions. He says there:
</p>
<p>“Economic prosperity, however widely diffused, will not extinguish crime. Many people
imagine that all the evils afflicting society spring from want, but this is only partially
true. A small number of crimes are probably due to sheer lack of food, but it has
to be borne in mind that crime would still remain an evil of enormous magnitude even
if there were no such calamities as destitution and distress. As a matter of fact
easy circumstances have less influence on conduct than is generally believed; prosperity
generates criminal inclinations as well as adversity, and on the whole the rich are
just as much addicted to crime as the poor.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16321src" href="#xd31e16321">4</a>
</p>
<p>The chapter “Climate and Crime” contains some observations that <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>are of interest in connection with our subject. In speaking of the great number of
crimes against persons in Italy, the author says:
</p>
<p>“Nor can it be said to be entirely due to economic distress. A condition of social
misery has undoubtedly something to do with the production of crime. In countries
where there is much wealth side by side with much misery, as in France and England,
adverse social circumstances drive a certain portion of the community into criminal
courses. But where this great inequality of social conditions does not exist—where
all are poor as in Ireland or Italy—poverty alone is not a weighty factor in ordinary
crime. In Ireland, for example, there is almost as much poverty as exists in Italy,
and if the amount of crime were determined by economic circumstances alone, Ireland
ought to have as black a record as her southern sister. Instead of that she is on
the whole as free from crime as the most prosperous countries of Europe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16330src" href="#xd31e16330">5</a>
</p>
<p>—This quotation is one of the best samples of Morrison’s logic and knowledge of facts!
Italy is poor; Ireland is poor; the former has many crimes, the latter few. Hence,
economic conditions are not an important factor. To say nothing of the care necessary
in comparing two countries where the penal law, police, courts, etc. are very different,
there is an error of logic in the quotation. For poverty may be in one of these countries
a determinant that leads to a certain phenomenon, while in another country it does
not lead to it, because neutralized by a counter-determinant. And then, the knowledge
of facts that Morrison gives evidence of here, is not great. It is not at all true
that in Italy every one is poor. On the contrary, there is plenty of wealth in that
country, while Ireland, on the other hand, is drained by landlords who <i>live elsewhere</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16337src" href="#xd31e16337">6</a>—
</p>
<p>The chapter that interests us next is that entitled “Destitution and Crime.” “A ‘destitute
person’ is a person who is without house or home, who has no work, who is able and
willing to work but can get none, and has nothing but starvation staring him in the
face.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16350src" href="#xd31e16350">7</a>
</p>
<p>According to Morrison there are two kinds of crime of which a destitute person may
be guilty, namely theft and mendicity. Two questions must be answered, then, first,
what percentage is there of these crimes? second, how far can one attribute theft
and mendicity to destitution?
</p>
<p>During the years 1887–1888 the number of cases tried in England <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>and Wales was 726,698, of which 8% were crimes against property and 7% offenses against
the “Vagrancy Acts.” Consequently 15% of all the crimes might have been committed
because of destitution. From investigations made by himself, half the thieves had
work and were earning something at the time they committed their crimes.
</p>
<p>Now we still have to explain the other half of the cases of theft. Those who committed
these thefts were without work, then; but there were among them habitual criminals,
and these could probably have found work, but did not want to work. Therefore they
were not “destitute persons.” This leaves still 25% of the thieves. Among these destitution
is now truly the direct cause. However lack of work is not the sole cause, but the
fact that children of proletarians are left to themselves when their parents are sick
or dead, enters in. And then many aged working-men become criminals because they are
too old to work and no one supports them. Drunkards also at times come to commit crimes
because of poverty, since they find it difficult to work. The estimate is, then, as
follows:
</p>

</p>
<p>Then come the infractions of the “Vagrancy Acts.” The offenses that are punished under
these laws are chiefly prostitution, presence in public places with criminal intentions,
presence in a particular house with criminal intentions, and carrying burglars’ implements.
Prostitution aside, destitution ought not to be considered as the cause of these infractions,
according to the author, because the guilty persons are those who ordinarily will
not work and would not change their lot for anyone else’s. The class of vagrants is
no more unhappy than any other; it has even its own philosophy. (—Who could be unhappy,
then? This statement of the case gives one a great desire to ask the author how it
happens that no people of means have adopted this enviable career.—) The same reasoning
applies to most of the mendicants (45% of those who break the vagrancy laws), they
do not want to work. Another fraction is made up of those who cannot find work; their
number is difficult to determine; according to Morrison’s opinion it is not very high
(he estimates it at 2% for mendicants). It is especially aged persons who belong to
this class. There are two principal reasons for this.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>First, the increasing use of machines, which throw workmen out of employment, while
increasing the possibility of utilizing the labor of women and children.
</p>
<p>—However true this observation, it is nevertheless very incomplete. It is not the
machine that is the cause, but the system of free labor, which throws everyone on
his own resources when he can work no longer, whether this is from lack of work or
from the disability of the worker.—
</p>
<p>A second cause of vagrancy and mendicity is to be found in the Trades Unions. For
these Unions have been able to obtain a uniform wage, and aged workmen must, in accordance
with their rules, earn as much as the young ones although not able to do as much work.
The employers, not being able to afford to give them the whole amount, discharge them.
</p>
<p>The circumstance that there are more male than female beggars is a proof to the author
that economic conditions are not the cause of mendicity, etc., for women ordinarily
live under worse conditions than men.
</p>
<p>“The only possible explanation of this state of thing is that vagrancy is, to a very
large extent, entirely unconnected with economic conditions; the position of trade
either for good or evil is a very secondary factor in producing this disease in the
body politic; its extirpation would not be effected by the advent of an economic millennium;
its roots are, as a rule, in the disposition of the individual and not to any serious
degree in the industrial constitution of society.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16416src" href="#xd31e16416">8</a>
</p>
<p>After having stated that, in his opinion, prostitution also has little to do with
economic conditions, Morrison arrives at the conclusion that 14% of the delinquents
under the Vagrancy Acts have been made so by destitution; as such delinquents constitute
7% of the total of the criminal population, these destitute persons form 2% of the
whole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16421src" href="#xd31e16421">9</a> Adding these 2% to the 2% of destitute persons among the thieves, we get a total
of 4%. Further, the author estimates the destitute persons among the other criminals
(those not punished for theft or infractions of the Vagrancy Acts) at 1%. Of all criminals,
then, 5% have become such from destitution, according to Morrison.
</p>
<p>—I shall not insist upon proving that these calculations have little value. In the
first place all the figures are only estimates, <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>without any indication of what they are based on. In the second place Morrison has
only proved, supposing his estimates are correct, that 5% of the criminals belong
to a category defined by the author himself. All this gives him absolutely no right
to conclude that economic conditions are not a powerful factor in crime. Just where
the writer believes that the question has been solved the difficulties properly commence.
If we wish to treat the question of vagrancy in a scientific manner we must ask: how
does it happen that with the present mode of production there are found persons who
prefer vagrancy to work? This is one of the questions that must be answered, yet for
Morrison it does not exist. The causes of professional theft, alcoholism, etc. seem,
according to the author, to have nothing to do with economic conditions. I shall show
in the second part of this work how far wrong he is.—
</p>
<p>The following chapter treats of “poverty and crime.” To prove the slightness of the
causal connection between the two, Morrison gives the following table:

<p>England is six times as rich as Italy, and the figure for theft is greater; hence,
economic conditions are not causes, etc. etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16536src" href="#xd31e16536">10</a>
</p>
<p>—It has been some years since Quetelet pointed out (see Chap. II, Sec. II, of this
work) that <i>absolute</i> wealth throws no light on the criminal question, because the total wealth of a country
gives no idea of its distribution. Yet Morrison thinks that the preceding table proves
the correctness of his statement!—
</p>
<p>The author sees a second proof in support of his reasoning in the fact that during
the prosperous period of 1870–74 criminality in England was greater than during the
period of economic depression from 1884 to 1888. (—See our summaries of the works
of Tugan-Baranowsky and of Müller, where it is shown that the economic conditions
<span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>of that period do have a relation to criminality. There is perhaps no country where
the connection between crime and the course of economic events is so close as in England;
and it is surprising that there are authors like Morrison who are so little in touch
with the situation, and who yet express themselves so decidedly.—)
</p>
<p>In America the immigrants commit fewer crimes on the average than those who are born
in the country; the position of these last being better, economic conditions are not
causes of crime. (—As if assertions as vague as this: “the American has a better position
than the immigrant”, could have any value!—)
</p>
<p>Morrison sees another proof in the fact that the criminality in the English colony
of Victoria, where prosperity is fairly general, differs little from that of other
countries where the prosperity is less. (—See A. Sutherland, “<span lang="fr"><span class="corr" id="xd31e16556" title="Source: Resultats">Résultats</span> de la déportation en Australie</span>”, <span lang="fr">Compte Rendu du Ve Congr. d’Anthr. Crim.</span>, p. 270, where it is shown that criminality in Australia on account of the deportation
of English criminals is great, but has fallen continually since 1850, and now is not
so high as in Italy, Sweden, Saxony, and Prussia. So this proof given by the author
is not convincing.—)
</p>
<p>Then the author draws attention to the fact that, according to him, the number of
criminals in the different classes of society in England is proportional to the respective
numbers of individuals in each of these classes. Finally he also thinks that his thesis
is supported by the fact that during the summer months the prisons in England are
more populated than in winter.
</p>
<p>—The author deceives himself, for to find out that more crimes are committed in winter
than in summer one has only to consult, not the statistics of the prisons, but those
of the courts; the former give no information as to the time when the offense was
committed; it is even probable that a part of the prisoners incarcerated in summer
committed their offenses in winter. Many writers who have not fallen into this error
have come to the conclusion that crimes and misdemeanors against property, which are
those chiefly in question, increase in winter and decrease in summer.
</p>
<p>If one wished to make a complete criticism of Morrison’s work it would be necessary
to write a whole book, so great is the number of his errors and omissions, which is
why I refer to the second part of my work.
</p>
<p>The fundamental error of the author is that he believes that the question of how far
economic conditions lead to crime is exhausted when the effect of poverty has been
investigated. This is only <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>a part (though an important one) of the question, which though apparently simple is
in reality very complicated.
</p>
<p>Finally, I must protest against the unmerited reproach that the English Trades Unions
are the cause of criminality among aged working-men. We live in a society in which
a great proportion of the men wear themselves out for a small wage in order to enrich
others, and where aged working-men who can now do little or no work are tossed aside
like oranges from which the juice has been squeezed. When they commit crimes, therefore,
it is society that is the cause of it, and not the unions, which, after years of struggle,
have succeeded in getting higher wages for their members than those of non-union labor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16572src" href="#xd31e16572">11</a>—

</p>
<p>“Crime is the necessary result of the joint action of two groups of conditions. The
first group is due, partly to the innate, partly to the acquired character of the
agent; the other to the environment surrounding him. The microbe of crime flourishes
only in the culture medium of society. This sentence, which has gradually become a
commonplace, indicates the significance of social conditions for the origination and
development of criminality.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16597src" href="#xd31e16597">13</a>
</p>
<p>“It is obvious that a diminution in the number of certain crimes may be brought about
by an improvement in the social order. The impulse toward crime is undoubtedly quickly
strengthened by social conditions, and also quickly made weaker. Political and religious
offenses become so much the more numerous, the more definitely and relentlessly the
dominant opinion takes its stand against diverse persuasions. If today a certain tendency
in art were to attain state recognition and the protection of the criminal law, tomorrow
the aesthetic heretic would be persecuted as the religious heretics were persecuted
in earlier centuries. The sexual instinct will constantly long for satisfaction and
take it where it finds it. If you prohibit the possibility of such satisfaction within
the bounds of legality, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>instinct will break the bonds and lead to crime. And whoever finds neither bread nor
work will, in the great majority of cases, be able to discover ways and means of securing
the one without the other at the expense of society.… ‘The beast in man’ is in all
circles, in all strata of our society.… But the beast, with all its wild passions,
with rage and hate, with covetousness and envy, with thirst for blood and insatiable
vanity, is it not derived from father or mother, who have drained the pleasures of
life or the woes of life to the dregs, who were corrupted in blood through their own
fault, or without their own fault, before they gave life to the germ to which they
imparted the curse of their forefathers as a heritage?
</p>
<p>“A reorganization of our social order will materially lessen the impulsion to crime
in the men who are living today, but infinitely more important and infinitely more
permanent will be its effect upon coming generations. While diminishing the number
of those tainted by heredity it will tame the beast in man. This is no Utopia. It
will be easier, perhaps, to underestimate the effect of such a transformation, than
to appreciate its full value.
</p>
<p>“But <i>which</i> transformation? That is the question that we must answer, if we are not to be pushed
aside as harmless visionaries.
</p>
<p>“Our entire education, in school as in life, rests upon suggestion. What keeps us
from crime is the inhibitory ideas, which are instilled into us until they permeate
our flesh and blood and control our actions, without our being conscious of it. ‘Thou
shalt’, ‘thou shalt not’, these general prescriptions of right and morality, of religion
and philanthropy, or whatever you choose to call it, must determine our conduct, unless
we stop to consider, hesitate, and delay.…
</p>
<p>“The inhibitory ideas, however, retain their force only if we live in the community
of our fellows, the enclosed circle held together by like views and a community of
interests. Put upon his own resources, the true man makes himself known. But the men
who can do this are rare. The great majority of us need outside support. Who has not
seen in his own experience how the judgment and prejudice, the beliefs and superstitions
of his associates have a determining effect upon him; how he supports others and is
supported by them? Break up the enclosed circle and you weaken or annihilate the inhibitory
ideas; shatter society to atoms, so that each stands by himself in the war of all
against all, and you set loose whatever evil instincts have their roots in us; ‘declass’
man and you have driven him into the arms of crime.
</p>
<p>“And this declassing has been most abundantly provided for by <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>our present economic system. It has unshackled egoism without setting any bounds to
it. It reaps what it sows. In the proletariat it has created the very medium in which
the microbe of crime flourishes. Next to the wealth of individuals lies the misery
of the masses. Do we still wonder, then, that the criminal-statistician laments an
increasing number of cases. Every society has the criminals that it deserves.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16615src" href="#xd31e16615">14</a>
</p>
<p>—The opinion of Professor von Liszt and of other bio-sociologists with regard to crime
is a union of the doctrine of the Italian and French schools. Having already given
a criticism of these schools I will limit myself to a few remarks.
</p>
<p>The formula, “every crime is the product of an individual factor on the one side,
and of social factors on the other”, is of little value for the question, being applicable
to every act, even the most laudable, and explains very little of what is peculiar
to crime. A more special examination of the so-called individual factor of crime shows
that it is formed, for example, of great needs, of highly developed muscular strength—in
short, of things which do not belong to crime alone; or it may be a lack of moral
conceptions (the result of an unfavorable environment, of bad education, etc.). A
veritable individual factor is to be found only in some special cases, where crime
is the result of a predisposition, resulting from a morbid mental condition, combined
with unfavorable circumstances. At times, then, crime is the resultant of an individual
factor with a social factor; in most cases this is not so. In maintaining that it
is always these two together which give birth to crime, one makes use of a commonplace,
since by individual factors are understood conditions necessary to every act; or else
the statement is quite inaccurate.
</p>
<p>Finally it may be said also that most of the bio-sociologists, while recognizing the
great influence exercised by environment do not give any description of this environment.
It is not enough to name social imperfections existing in our days, and to demand
their reform, one after another; we must first of all find out whether these imperfections
are connected with the present economic system, and can be removed without attacking
the system itself.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16623src" href="#xd31e16623">15</a>—

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his work, “<span lang="de">Verbrechen und Wahnsinn beim Weibe</span>”, Dr. Näcke treats the criminal question from the medico-anthropological point of
view. However, his remarks upon the connection which exists between economic conditions
and crime are very important. In the fifth chapter, entitled, “<span lang="de">Die anthropologisch-biologischen Beziehungen zum Verbrechen und Wahnsinn beim Weibe</span>”, he puts the question: can one fix the idea of “crime” anatomically?
</p>
<p>According to him the answer must be an absolute negative. “Semal is right when he
says: ‘The moral sense is a slow and gradual acquisition of the ages.… The conscience
of peoples like that of the individual, calls every act moral that is useful to the
agent himself or to others.…’ Every people, then, fixes the concept ‘crime’ according
to the moral code prevailing among them at the time; it is consequently not rooted
in man physiologically, but is as Manouvrier brilliantly demonstrates, purely sociological.
It is therefore really nonsense to seek for anthropological stigmata for a sociological
concept.
</p>
<p>“But another consideration also leads us to the same result. The stability of a people
demands the establishing of certain boundaries, called ‘laws’, the transgression of
which might disturb the social order, and therefore must be punished. But the laws
form only single boundary marks, not a tight enclosure, so that between them many,
consciously or not, pass through without being caught or <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>punished. Besides, the laws of a higher morality do not always correspond with the
prevailing legal system, so that many things are offenses in the eyes of the moral
code that are not such in the eyes of the law, a fact which, as is well known, the
conscienceless take advantage of. It is plain, therefore, that there are innumerable
transgressions that are not punished, innumerable criminals who pass as honest men,
so that we cannot really speak of criminals and honest men, but simply of the punished
and the unpunished.
</p>
<p>“Punishment is, however, as we have already seen, a poor criterion. Habitual criminals
are often not nearly so depraved as many persons of good reputation, especially in
certain districts whose moral concepts are of a very elastic kind; or as others who
have, to be sure, been punished but once, but who, in all their actions, have always
been crafty criminals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16741src" href="#xd31e16741">17</a>
</p>
<p>“As there is to be found no such thing as absolute bodily and mental soundness, so
there is no such thing as an absolutely ‘honest’ man. ‘We are altogether sinners’,
say the Scriptures with entire truth—and not in thought only—none of us is proof against
becoming a criminal, and under certain circumstances, even a great one.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16746src" href="#xd31e16746">18</a>
</p>
<p>“There is an unbroken gradation from the purest to the worst man. When we speak simply
of ‘criminals’ we mean only those standing on the farthest step, who are not always,
however, the worst. It is a question, then, of the refuse of the world, and not of
real crime. In every environment there are always individuals who become evil-doers
exclusively or chiefly through circumstances—this possibility no mortal can escape—and
on the other hand there are those who owe this in part (seldom, however, exclusively)
to their inferior psychic personality, which allows them to run counter to the prevailing
morality and drives them to breach of the law; these last constitute the criminals
in the narrow sense.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16751src" href="#xd31e16751">19</a>
</p>
<p>In chapter VI, “<span lang="de">Zusammenhang von Verbrechen und Wahnsinn</span>”, the author explains that in case an individual factor exists, it is not ordinarily
this alone that leads to crime, but it must be coupled with a social factor.
</p>
<p>This is what Dr. Näcke says of the causes of this individual factor: “Indeed it is
even probable that in the last analysis the individual factor is dependent upon the
environment, since this so influenced the parents, grandparents, etc. that the germ
of the next generation must have been injured directly or later through corrupted
blood <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>or narrow pelvis on the part of the mother (both again dependent upon the environment).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16763src" href="#xd31e16763">20</a>
</p>
<p>Further along he makes this idea more specific, when he is examining the different
causes of crime. Among these causes the author cites the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> Lesion of the germ (favored especially by the marriage of degenerates).
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> Alcoholism.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> Syphilis.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> Malnutrition and unhealthy mode of life.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> Excessive labor of women and children.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">6.</span> Bad domestic life.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">7.</span> Desertion in which children under age are left.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The author sums up in the following terms: “In what has gone before we have attempted
to pick out and follow up some threads of the complex social fabric, in the firm persuasion
that only an improvement of the environment in its thousand-fold ramifications will
be able effectively to combat crime, and gradually to exert a favorable influence
upon the individual factors, which are certainly not to be undervalued.
</p>
<p>“If we survey the whole matter, everything comes in the end to the stomach-question;
only so long as this is not solved—and perhaps it never can be satisfactorily solved—must
we keep the point of view given above practically before us, which, upon the solution
of the matter, becomes in large measure no longer necessary.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16802src" href="#xd31e16802">21</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The work of Dr. Havelock Ellis, entitled “The Criminal”, contains only one passage
which is of importance for the question of <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>criminality considered from the economic point of view. Like most bio-sociologists
he considers the social factors as the most important. This is the passage in question:
</p>
<p>“The problem of criminality is not an isolated one that can be dealt with by fixing
our attention on that and that alone. It is a problem that on closer view is found
to merge itself very largely into all those problems of our social life that are now
pressing for solution, and in settling them we shall to a great extent settle it.
The rising flood of criminality is not an argument for pessimism or despair. It is
merely an additional spur to that great task of social organization to which during
the coming century we are called.
</p>
<p>“It is useless, or worse than useless, to occupy ourselves with methods for improving
the treatment of criminals, so long as the conditions of life render the prison a
welcome and desired shelter. So long as we foster the growth of reckless classes we
foster the growth of criminality. So long as there are a large body of women in the
East of London, and in other large centers, who are prepared to say, ‘It’s Jack the
Ripper or the bridge with me. What’s the odds?’ there will be a still larger number
of persons who will willingly accept the risks of prison. ‘What’s the odds?’ Liberty
is dear to every man who is fed and clothed and housed, and he will not usually enter
a career of crime unless he has carefully calculated the risks of losing his liberty,
and found them small; but food and shelter are even more precious than liberty, and
these may be secured in prison. As things are, the asylum and the workhouse, against
which there is a deep prejudice, ingrained and irrational, would have a greater deterring
effect than the prison. There are every morning in Paris 50,000 persons who do not
know how they will eat or where they will sleep. It is the same in every great city;
for such the prison can be nothing but a home. It is well known that the life of the
convict, miserable as it is, with its dull routine and perpetual surveillance, is
yet easier, less laborious, and far more healthy than that to which thousands of honest
working-men are condemned throughout Great Britain.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16854src" href="#xd31e16854">23</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The author of the brochure, “The Relation of Economic Conditions to the Causes of
Crime”, begins by declaring that there are two kinds <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>of criminals; persons who have become such from their psycho-physical constitution,
and others who have become such from circumstances.
</p>
<p>“I believe the criminal is an undeveloped man in all his elements, whether you think
of him as a worker or as a moral and intellectual being. His faculties are all undeveloped,
not only those which enable him to labor honestly and faithfully for the care and
support of himself and his family, but also all his moral and intellectual faculties.
He is not a fallen being: he is an undeveloped individual.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16869src" href="#xd31e16869">24</a>
</p>
<p>The author then continues by saying that since there is a relation more or less close
between all the important social questions and the labor question, it is necessary
to take that up also in studying the criminal question.
</p>
<p>We know that there are three great systems of labor: the system resting upon slavery,
the feudal system, and the system now in force, <i>i.e.</i> that of free labor. In the first two, which intrinsically do not differ much, crime
had a totally different character from what it has under the last. Under the feudal
system the peasants lived in the most deplorable condition, without hope of betterment.
In many countries conditions were so bad that great bands of thieves and brigands
overran them. During the reign of Henry VIII, which lasted 38 years, 72,000 criminals
were executed. “Pauperism, therefore, did not attract legislation, and crime, the
offspring of pauperism and idleness, was brutally treated; and these conditions, betokening
an unsound social condition, existed until progress made pauperism, and crime as well,
the disgrace of the nation, and it was then that pauperism began to be recognized
as a condition that might be relieved through legislation.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16877src" href="#xd31e16877">25</a>
</p>
<p>In the end the feudal system was overthrown and that of free labor, the present system,
became general. Since then the differences between poverty and wealth have appeared
more distinctly.
</p>
<p>“Carry industry to a country not given to mechanical production or to any systematic
form of labor, employ three-fourths of its inhabitants, give them a taste of education,
of civilization, make them feel the power of moral forces even in a slight degree,
and the misery of the other fourth can be gauged by the progress of the three-fourths,
and a class of paupers and resultant criminals will be observed. We have in our own
day a most emphatic illustration of this in the emancipation of slaves in this country
(America). Under the old system the negro slave was physically comfortable, as a rule.
He was <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>cared for, he was nursed in sickness, fed and clothed, and in old age his physical
comforts were continued. He had no responsibility, and, indeed, exercised no skill
beyond what was taught him. To eat, to work and to sleep were all that was expected
of him, and, unless<span></span> he had a cruel master, he lived the life that belongs to the animal. Since his emancipation
and his endowment with citizenship he has been obliged to support himself and his
family, and to contend with all obstacles belonging to a person in a state of freedom.
Under the system of villeinage in the old country it could not be said that there
were any general poor, for the master and the lord of the manor took care of the laborers
their whole lives; and in our Southern towns, during slavery, this was true, so that
in the South there were few, if any, poorhouses, and few, if any, inmates of penal
institutions. The South today knows what pauperism is, as England learned when the
system of villeinage departed. Southern prisons have become active, and all that belongs
to the defective, the dependent, and the delinquent classes has come to be familiar
to the South.…” “But so far as the modern industrial order superinduces idleness or
unemployment, in so far it must be considered as having a direct relation to the causes
of crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16887src" href="#xd31e16887">26</a>
</p>
<p>After having tried to show, by the aid of some historical examples, that the conditions
in the system which preceded ours were of a nature much more serious than those of
our own day, he continues as follows:
</p>
<p>“In the study of economic conditions, and whatever bearing they may have upon crime,
I can do no better than to repeat, as a general idea, a statement made some years
ago by Mr. Ira Steward, of Massachusetts, one of the leading labor reformers in that
state in his day. He said: ‘Starting in the labor problem from whatever point we may,
we reach, as the ultimate cause of our industrial, social, moral, and material difficulties,
the terrible fact of poverty. By poverty we mean something more than pauperism. The
latter is a condition of entire dependence upon charity, while the former is a condition
of want, of lack, of being without, though not necessarily a condition of complete
dependence.’
</p>
<p>“It is in this view that the proper understanding of the subject given me, in its
comprehensiveness and the development of the principles which underlie it, means the
consideration of the abolition of pauperism and the eradication of crime; and the
definitions given by Mr. Steward carry with them all the elements of those great <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>special inquiries embodied in the very existence of our vast charitable, penal, and
reformatory institutions, ‘How shall poverty be abolished, and crime be eradicated?’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16896src" href="#xd31e16896">27</a>
</p>
<p>Let the circumstances be favorable or unfavorable, let the governments be liberal
or despotic, let the religion and commercial systems be what they may, crime has always
existed. This is why it would exist even if there were no longer any unemployment,
if everyone had received an education, if the efforts of temperance societies and
social reformers had been realized, and Christianity were universal. But all these
good influences together would certainly reduce crime to the minimum.
</p>
<p>Criminality will decrease but little if the improvements have to do simply with the
physical condition and not at the same time with moral and intellectual conditions.
It is, on the other hand, not to be disputed, according to the author, that a development
of these last qualities will have a favorable influence upon criminality. For the
man who has received an education will betake himself to crime less quickly than the
ignorant man, while on account of his education he will generally be able to find
work to protect him against poverty and crime. The lack of work is an important cause
of crime; for example, among the convicts of Massachusetts there were 68% who had
been without work, and in the whole United States in 1890, 74% of the murderers had
been without work. This lack of employment may have been because of an antipathy to
work or of a lack of opportunity. And it is this last case especially that occurs
only too often in the present social organization.
</p>
<p>Great improvements are urgently demanded; living conditions must become better and
more sanitary, and work must be better paid. The fundamental complaint of the writer
against political economy is that it has not considered moral forces as one of its
elements. As soon as it shall have considered them as such it will have entered upon
the way that leads to real improvements.
</p>
<p>After having indicated what these improvements ought to be, the author goes on in
these terms: “In a state in which labor had all its rights there would be, of course,
little pauperism and little crime. On the other hand, the undue subjection of the
laboring man must tend to make paupers and criminals, and entail a financial burden
upon wealth which it would have been easier to prevent than to endure; and this prevention
must come in a large degree through educated labor.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Do not understand me as desiring to give the impression that I believe crime to be
a necessary accompaniment of our industrial system. I have labored in other places
and at other times to prove the reverse, and I believe the reverse to be true. Our
sober, industrious working men and women are as free from vicious and criminal courses
as any other class. What I am contending for, relates entirely to conditions affecting
the few. The great volume of crime is found outside the real ranks of industry.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16908src" href="#xd31e16908">28</a>
</p>
<p>It might still be asked whether civilization favors crime. The answer would have to
be at once affirmative and negative. Affirmative in exceptional times, otherwise negative.
The more civilization advances, the better the condition of the working people will
become, the more equitable will be the division of profits, and the more crime will
diminish. The attempts of Robert Owen and many others prove the truth of this.
</p>
<p>The author closes his study with these words: “Trade instruction, technical education,
manual training—all these are efficient elements in the reduction of crime, because
they all help to better and truer economic conditions. I think, from what I have said,
the elements of solution are clearly discernible. Justice to labor, equitable distribution
of profits under some system which I feel sure will supersede the present, and without
resorting to socialism, instruction in trades by which a man can earn his living outside
a penal institution, the practical application of the great moral law in all business
relations—all these elements, with the more enlightened treatment of the criminal
when apprehended, will lead to a reduction in the volume of crime, but not to the
millennium; for ‘human experience from time immemorial tells us that the earth neither
was, nor is, nor ever will be, a heaven, nor yet a hell’, (Dr. A. Schäffle) but the
endeavor of right-minded men and women, the endeavor of every government, should be
to make it less a hell and more a heaven.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16914src" href="#xd31e16914">29</a>
</p>
<p>—The study of Carroll D. Wright contains some very true observations upon the relation
between crime and economic conditions (for example, upon the difference between the
slave and the free laborer, whose liberty consists chiefly in this, that he can die
of hunger if he cannot find work or is no longer able to work). But in general the
work gives the impression of vagueness and hesitation proper to the school of economists
and sociologists to which the writer belongs. They condemn certain manifestations
of capitalism, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>wish to maintain the “<span lang="la">causa causarum</span>”, the system itself. This is not the place to speak of this more fully and I will
confine myself to pointing out some historical errors of the author.
</p>
<p>In the first place, a classification of economic systems into only three is incomplete.
It is very surprising that this error should have been made by an American. For the
North American Indians neither lived under the feudal system nor under that of free
labor, and for the most part never knew slavery; the author has forgotten to mention
the primitive-communistic mode of production.
</p>
<p>In the second place, it is incorrect to call all those who lived under the feudal
system “poor.”
</p>
<p>In the third place it was not to the feudal system that the famous executions under
Henry VIII belong, but rather to incipient capitalism which, by dispossessing a great
number of peasants, made them poor. (Compare More, “Utopia”, and Marx, “Capital.”)—

<p class="small">[<span class="sc">Note to the American Edition</span>: Of the recent literature there should be mentioned: in Germany, especially <i>Aschaffenburg</i>, “<span lang="de">Das Verbrechen und seine Bekämpfung</span>”, and <i>Wulffen</i>, “<span lang="de">Psychologie des Verbrechens</span>.” In Holland the authors already named, van Kan, and de Roos are to be classed among
the bio-sociologists. For Russia there should be added <i>von Bechterew</i>, “<span lang="de">Das Verbrechertum im Lichte der objektiven Psychologie</span>.” In America it seems to me more reliance is placed upon the Italian theory than
in Europe; see, for example, <i>Henderson</i>, “Introduction into the Study of the Dependent, Defective, and Delinquent Classes.”

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">H. Joly.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is in the second chapter of his “<span lang="fr">France criminelle</span>”, bearing the title of “<span lang="fr">Richesse et misère</span>”, that the author gives his opinion of the connection between criminality and economic
conditions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17057src" href="#xd31e17057">2</a>
</p>
<p>According to Joly, the opinion expressed by many persons that poverty is the great
factor in criminality, appears to be true, at least at first sight; for the problem<span></span> is, in fact, very complex and difficult.
</p>
<p>In the first place a distinction must be made between voluntary and involuntary poverty.
“With vagrants by profession, beggars from choice and speculation, drunkards, those
who have made up their minds to live no matter how, gamblers who have systematically
used up their capital and that of their family, workmen who have given up work only
from rebellion against society, yes, with all these poverty leads to crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17066src" href="#xd31e17066">3</a> The second kind of poverty springs from disease, accidents, etc., <i>i.e.</i> from causes independent of the will of man.
</p>
<p>“There are, then, evidently innocent poor people; and there are others so much the
more pardonable as the consequences have been aggravated by the fault of others. Is
it then in the intermediate region that we must seek for the influences that lead
to evil? It may be. This region is not unknown to us. Let us seek here, without taking
sides in any way, and examine the facts as well as we can.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17073src" href="#xd31e17073">4</a>
</p>
<p>In opposition to the continual increase of criminality the author shows that the national
wealth has increased, although—and this should not be forgotten—real property, with
the exception of small <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>holdings, has decreased; the condition of the rural workers, on the contrary, has
improved.
</p>
<p>In the second place Joly calls attention to the condition of working-men in the cities.
According to him the question of whether it has grown worse must be answered in the
negative, for the emigration from the country to the city always keeps up. Notwithstanding
their higher wages men are no better off there, since they spend upon amusements their
additional earnings. If criminality increases among them it is not, then, in involuntary
poverty that the cause is to be found.
</p>
<p>At the same time with the increase of wages the price of food must be noted. In most
of the departments of France these prices have risen in the same proportion as wages.
Consequently the working-man has not become better off. He has new needs, but when
he has met these he has not enough left for the primary necessities. It is not economic
factors, but moral factors, that come into play here.
</p>
<p>The proportional increase of wages and the price of food, of which mention has been
made above, in the different departments of France, is not met with in the departments
of Morbihan, Vendée, <span class="corr" id="xd31e17084" title="Source: Bouches-du-Rhone">Bouches-du-Rhône</span>, and Hérault. In the first two, prices have risen much more than wages, while the
contrary appears in the last two. As regards criminality, the first two take their
place among those that show the lowest figures, the last two among those that show
the highest. Joly draws from this the conclusion that social life is too complicated
for us to be able to learn the morality of persons merely from the rise or fall of
wages. In any case it is certain, according to him, that the increase of criminality
that has been shown is not due to poverty, and that consequently we have not the right
to say that poverty in general is one of the primary causes of crime.
</p>
<p>However, it must not be lost sight of that in speaking of the increase of wealth and
the rise in wages, we are speaking only of average figures, and that there are many
individuals whose wages remain below this average. “Now, where do we see the greatest
differences, and where are they most felt? Exactly in wealthy epochs and in wealthy
surroundings. So it is in the poor departments that crimes against property develop
the least. There are two reasons for this, psychological and social. What any man
feels the most is not being or having absolutely; it is being or having more or less
than those who surround him. What must drive men to crime chiefly, then, is the comparison
of wealth with poverty.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17089src" href="#xd31e17089">5</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>Joly thinks he can produce further data upon the connection between crime and poverty
by checking up the kind of articles that are most frequently stolen. Out of 1000 cases
of theft (assizes, 1830–1860) there were 395 cases of theft of money, next came thefts
of personal property, then clothing, etc., then successively, different kinds of merchandise,
jewelry and table-ware, food, grain, etc., and living domestic animals. This information
does not teach us much about the relationship in question. For the articles stolen
can be sold, which prevents our discovering the motives of the crime.
</p>
<p>The analysis of the value of the objects stolen also gives us little information.
During a period of 25 years the cases of theft of 10 to 50 francs were the most numerous
(about 30%), next those of 100 to 1000 francs, then those of less than 10 francs.
Ten years later the most numerous were those of 100 to 1000 <span class="corr" id="xd31e17097" title="Source: frances">francs</span> (33%).
</p>
<p>However, on the strength of the statements of an old police officer, Joly thinks he
can draw the conclusion that poverty enters only to a small extent into the etiology
of crime. Nevertheless the established fact that a rise in the price of grain is associated
with an increase of criminality, contradicts this. But according to Joly the contradiction
is only apparent. “Famines are exceptional; theft is constant and while famines are
always decreasing, theft is always increasing. Suppose that in ordinary years people
did not steal or stole very little; the difficult moments would find them more patient,
more resolute to have recourse to legal and permissible means; we should not see them
so prompt to extricate themselves from their difficulties by simply taking the property
of others. But what resistance can we count on from those who have long had the habit
of stealing from fancy, cupidity, or a desire to gormandize? What resistance can be
hoped for, especially when the habit has begun in youth? Now, we have seen that a
third of the thefts are committed by minor children.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17102src" href="#xd31e17102">6</a>
</p>
<p>The weakness of the influence of economic conditions upon criminality is, according
to Joly, further proved by the fact that times of prosperity are not accompanied by
a decrease in the number but by a change in the kind of crime committed (as Prins
and <span class="corr" id="xd31e17107" title="Source: Garafalo">Garofalo</span> have shown). Cheap wine makes most crimes against persons increase. But the low price
of grain has the same effect, since the working-man, when his condition has improved
even a little, spends his additional earnings in all kinds of amusements, which, in
their turn, may be the source of crime. This is proved, for example, by the fact that
in Marseilles suicides are most numerous on Sunday and Monday, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>fewest on Friday and Saturday, a fact explained by the pay-days of the working people.
This is also applicable to crimes against persons.
</p>
<p>To prove his thesis the author reminds us of the fact that domestics, although not
subject to privations, furnish a large percentage of the thefts; that the percentage
of thefts committed by unmarried persons continually increases; and finally, that
the investigation (of 107 cases tried in 10 years before the assizes at Rheims), made
by a magistrate (Ch. Vuébat), has proved that economic factors have little importance
for criminality, and moral factors much. “To sum up, it is not the increase of poverty
that is the cause of the increase of crime; it is not property in general that leads
to crime against property. This is not saying that poverty, and innocent poverty,
does not exist, nor that it is not a bad counselor, nor that it is not the duty of
the upper classes and of the government to concern themselves with the lot of the
poor. It does mean that a man is less led into evil-doing by the faults of others
or by the fault of destiny than by his personal faults.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17114src" href="#xd31e17114">7</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>—If one considers the study of the question by Joly from a critical point of view,
the thing that most strikes the attention is this; that he puts economic causes <i>by the side of</i> the moral causes of criminality. As I have already more than once remarked, this
is not sound. Every crime finds its origin in moral causes, or better, in the lack
of moral ideas dominant at a certain period. But one of the principal questions to
be answered is this; how far do these moral ideas find their origin in definite economic
conditions? Joly, being a spiritualist, has not succeeded in formulating this problem
well, still less in solving it.
</p>
<p>His entire treatment of the relation between criminality and economic conditions is
characterized by a striking narrowness. He speaks of poverty and wealth as if they
were the most natural things in the world, and had no need to be explained. Then he
makes a distinction between voluntary and involuntary poverty, and excludes the former
from the discussion as having nothing to do with the problem in question. This manner
of reasoning has rather the air of a penitential sermon than of a scientific investigation.
“Voluntary poverty”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17125src" href="#xd31e17125">8</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>is a contradiction in terms. For a man tries as far as possible to spare himself suffering
and to gain happiness. There can never be any such thing then as voluntary poverty.
</p>
<p>Though his terms are unhappily chosen, Joly only wishes to point out that poverty
may originate in circumstances or in the person himself. But in treating this problem
he should not have been silent on a very important, and very difficult point, namely
how far these individual causes of poverty are based upon the present economic system.
</p>
<p>If the question treated by Joly is incomplete, what he says neither has any great
value, nor does it prove at all his statement that the influence of economic conditions
is small. He gives but a few pages to the very difficult question of whether the standard
of living of the working class has been raised. He brings out the universally observed
fact that the wants of all classes have increased, but he seems not to have noted
that this is intimately bound up with the present mode of production. He cites the
testimony of an old police officer, and the investigations of a magistrate (investigations,
it may be said in passing, that reached the colossal number of 107 cases) in order
to prove that most crimes are not committed as a consequence of immediate privations—as
if this were enough to solve the question of how far economic conditions enter into
the causes of crime.—<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17145src" href="#xd31e17145">9</a>

<p class="first">In his ninth chapter, entitled “<span lang="fr">Le crime et la misère</span>,” this author gives some pages to our subject. It is incontestable, according to
him, that poverty exerts an influence upon criminality. The number of crimes increases
in the years of poor crops, or when there is a lack of work owing to industrial or
agricultural crises. Thus, criminality reached high figures in 1840, 1847, and 1854,
when the price of grain was high.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this and of his personal experience (the author is a magistrate)
he thinks the opinion of Garofalo is incorrect, that poverty only gives crime its
form and is not a cause of it. For indigence not only puts morality in danger by depriving
some persons of the bare necessities, but it also causes the children of the poor
in the great cities to be brought up in a pitiable manner.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although the author is of this opinion, however, he does not subscribe to the view
that “the poor man is dedicated to crime.” On the contrary, a great proportion of
the poor are as honest as possible, and have honorable toil as their only means of
support. Judicial statistics show that the rich are as guilty of crime as the poor.
</p>
<p>“We see, then, that even if all the citizens had means and education, there would
always be criminals; the number of them would be a little less, but not much. There
would always be traders practising deception with regard to the quantity and quality
of their goods, merchants adulterating food, employes abusing the confidence of their
employers, notaries embezzling the funds entrusted to them; there would always be
wives poisoning their husbands, and husbands killing their wives, and teachers of
lay and denominational schools committing sexual crimes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17178src" href="#xd31e17178">11</a>
</p>
<p>Most crimes are not committed to escape from want, but rather to procure luxury and
pleasure. Hence the rich as well as the poor commit them. “To sum up, I do not believe
that the rich are less tempted to take the property of others than the poor. The more
wealth one has the more he wants; further, the more wealth increases, the more factitious
wants increase, and if one’s wealth becomes insufficient to satisfy these wants, the
thought of increasing it by any means is not slow in coming. Admitting that some day
all men may be rich and educated, though that seems to me to be an impossible dream,
cupidity will always make thieves, rogues, and forgers; hatred and revenge will always
inspire homicide, murder, and arson; debauchery will always lead to sexual crimes.
Material and intellectual progress will never suppress the passions and will not free
men from the struggle that must be maintained against them. It will always be necessary
to repress anger and sensuality, to put a bridle upon cupidity, and, in a word, to
set the soul free from its passions. The increase of well-being and education will
never make the police and the penal code unnecessary.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17183src" href="#xd31e17183">12</a>
</p>
<p>—It will be superfluous to give a criticism of this discussion. We have already met
several authors who took this point of view. Proal is like the others who do not even
know how to put the question of the influence of economic conditions clearly, who
do not comprehend that poverty and riches are both the inevitable consequences of
the same system.—

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“It is an incontestable fact that the influence of poverty upon criminality is immense.”
It is thus that the author expresses himself in the introduction to his work. I shall
set forth his manner of defending this thesis in the following lines.
</p>
<p>The most disastrous consequence of poverty is the temptation to procure illicitly
what is needed for one’s well-being. We can see this in the crimes of crowds as well
as in individual crimes. At the 3d Congress of Criminal Anthropology, Professor H.
Denis gave certain facts with regard to the correlation between crime and the economic
status.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17208src" href="#xd31e17208">14</a> During the years from 1845 to 1849 the curve of criminality coincides exactly with
that of the price of wheat. But at the close of 1850 the two curves diverge, when
the curve of wheat is replaced by that of staple foods in general. If we follow the
trend of wages attentively we shall note that they also are higher in the last years.
The increase of criminality is no longer to be explained, therefore, by this rise.
To what, then, is it due?
</p>
<p>In the author’s opinion we must note, first, that forced unemployment is increasing;
second, that poverty and wealth have force only by comparison.
</p>
<p>The well-being of the working man has increased, but that of men in general much more
so. This explains only a part of the phenomena given above. The rest of his explanation
is as follows: “There are, in fact, other elements, which may neutralize the influence
of the environment. To all the solicitations of vice and crime man can offer resistance,
finding his refuge and support in moral force.
</p>
<p>“Now, go to the poor and unhappy, and ask them what prevents them from quickly slipping
downhill into crime, and you will find in their mouths the expression, naïve, but
strong, of the idea of duty; and this idea of duty you will find precisely and clearly
only in that of submission to an absolute, incontestable, unconditioned authority,
that of God. A man whom no one would suspect of any extraordinary good-will toward
religion, M. Jules Simon, said a few months ago, ‘The peoples must be brought to God
if we want justice and order to reign.’
</p>
<p>“Must not even those who do not themselves believe, recognize in <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>this idea of duty, of law imposed by a God, the creator, an ‘idée-force,’ a source
in itself of energy and activity against evil and for good?
</p>
<p>“It is in the diminution of this energy, in the efforts that have been made to tear
out of the hearts of the poor this root, whose flower is hope, and whose fruit is
virtue, that I am inclined to see one of the causes of the frightful increase of crime,
which all concede, some with surprise and all with dismay.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17220src" href="#xd31e17220">15</a>
</p>
<p>In the second part of his discussion the author brings up the degenerating influence
of poverty. Although a man has a free will at his disposal, it is necessary that he
should also have an organism capable of putting the will into action. Hence it is
that degeneracy makes its effect felt upon man.
</p>
<p>“Now, misery is just the totality of the most imperious desires remaining unsatisfied;
it is the love of life, the love of well-being left without gratification; it is the
suffering of the wife one would like to see happy, the hunger of the children to whom
one would like to give bread. And if crime can give this bread that one cannot find,
if crime can satisfy all these appetites, all these desires, it will present itself
with the most powerful attractions, with the charm of fascination. Will the unfortunate
man have the supreme energy to prefer duty to enjoyment?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17226src" href="#xd31e17226">16</a>
</p>
<p>Poverty is a bad preparatory school for this contest; a weakened organism will succumb
more easily to temptation. And generally this is accompanied by a lack of education
and of the development of the higher faculties.
</p>
<p>In following the course of life of a proletarian we see that the child of the proletariat
carries, often from his birth, the signs of degeneracy, since his mother was forced
to work hard during her pregnancy. From his childhood he is ill nourished, and grows
up in an unhealthful environment. There can hardly be any question of education, for
his father and mother work in the shop, which prevents any family life. The child
is not attached to the dwelling of his parents and wanders in the street, where he
picks up bad habits. Arrived at adolescence, he enters the factory to pass the greater
part of his time in monotonous occupations. And once full grown, life for him consists
only in routine labor, monotonous and without end. “However, this man has a soul,
he has a mind! But it slumbers in a perpetual inertia. Nothing in his life has awakened
what is grand, noble, and divine in this reasonable being. How can we hope to have
the moral energy and the sublime ambition for good survive in him?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17233src" href="#xd31e17233">17</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>However unhappy this manner of life may be, there is still lacking the greatest misfortune
that can befall the proletarian; forced inaction. This is one of the chief causes
that can drive him to commit crime! And then there is another scourge of the working
class, alcoholism. “Source of poverty without any doubt, but fruit of poverty incontestably.”
Finally, of all the proletarians the most unhappy are the women. Low wages and the
monotony of tiresome work too often make prostitutes of them.
</p>
<p>To all these criminogenous causes the Christian must oppose the moral sentiments which
are drawn from his religion. His motto must be, “rather death than dishonor.” But
for that he must have heroic courage, which most people lack. Perhaps before God these
sinners will find grace.
</p>
<p>But all this cannot be a reason for society to allow to exist these scandalous conditions,
which, in a few words, are as follows: “Insufficiency of the means of subsistence;
work too long continued, as measured by the exhaustion resulting from it; work demanded
of mothers of families; excessive and unsuitable labor expected of children; improper
conditions in certain industries.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17241src" href="#xd31e17241">18</a>
</p>
<p>This must be changed, and it is possible to do so. Not, however, with the aid of the
state, for then industry would lose the elasticity so necessary to it. But the change
must be brought about by association of the proletarians. “In the forced individualism
of the laborers is to be found the cause of their ruin; the salvation must be found
in association.” The author closes by referring to the encyclical, “<span lang="la">Rerum novarum</span>”, in which it is said that Christian workmen must band together, and by encouraging
the rich to help their less privileged brothers.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17249src" href="#xd31e17249">19</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The authors of whom I have just been speaking, together with others, like von Oettingen
and Stursberg, of whom I have spoken in Chap. II, have this idea in common, that the
continually growing irreligion is a cause of the increase in criminality; in other
words, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>irreligion is a powerful factor of crime and that the irreligious are predisposed
to crime.
</p>
<p>What proofs have been given by these authors in support of their thesis, their very
serious accusation against those who are no longer religious? Most of them have not
even tried to prove it. It is a dogma, with which, therefore, we have nothing to do.
An increase of irreligion had been shown, also an increase in criminality, <i>therefore</i> there is a causal connection. Protest must be made against any such methods of reasoning.
If there is a parallelism upon the chart between two curves that do not undulate,
we must be very careful about drawing the conclusion that there is a connection, much
more a causal one. That irreligion has increased is certain; is the same thing true
of criminality? Certainly not. The trend of criminality <i>as a whole</i> is very rarely uniform, there is almost always a divergence; for example, economic
criminality and violent criminality very rarely keep pace with each other. If we wish
to give a general idea of the trend of criminality, we can only say that it is decreasing
rather than increasing. The spiritualist authors often cite Germany in support of
their thesis. This is no longer possible, for, after an increase in the total figures
up to the end of the nineteenth century, there is now a fluctuating decrease.
</p>
<p>In the Netherlands we can estimate the increase of irreligion;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17292src" href="#xd31e17292">20</a> according to the censuses of 1879 and 1909, the percentage of those who are not members
of any church has increased enormously, from 0.31 to 4.97, an increase of 1500% in
30 years! What an increase of crime must we look for! The reality is very different.
The curve of crime has fallen without any doubt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17298src" href="#xd31e17298">21</a> The facts and the thesis do not agree.
</p>
<p>Another way of examining the question is to be found in “criminal geography.” Since
irreligion shows enormous differences in the different parts of a country, we ought
to find considerable criminality in the provinces where the lack of religion is most
in evidence. For the Netherlands, in my study already referred to, I have given detailed
tables with the result that there is no connection between the phenomena in question.
In general we have even the right to say that the provinces with the lowest figures
for irreligion show a high criminality, and vice versa!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>The best means of settling the question is by a direct statistical study. I have made
calculations, based upon the criminal statistics, of more than 126,000 individuals
sentenced during the period from 1901 to 1909, in the Netherlands. Here are the results:

<p>The results are the following, then: the first place is almost always occupied by
the Catholics, the second by the Protestants, and then come the Jews (except in cases
of receiving stolen goods, embezzlement, and fraud), and the minimum of criminality
(in all crimes without exception) is shown by the irreligious!
</p>
<p>Here we have not the task of explaining this fact, we only bring it out; and we have
the right to declare that the thesis: “irreligion leads to crime”, is not correct.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the first chapter of his “<span lang="it">Il delitto e la questione sociale</span>”, the author shows that among the numerous misfortunes from which the proletariat
suffers, this must be reckoned, that it is almost exclusively from its ranks that
criminals are recruited. “The criminal tribute is the almost exclusive privilege of
one social class. And as the bourgeoisie has so far thought out no better plan than
to oppose the degradation of crime with another degradation called punishment, it
has come about that to the monopoly of the criminal tribute is added, for the poor,
the monopoly of the penal tribute.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17649src" href="#xd31e17649">2</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>After having spoken, in the following chapter, of “free will”, Dr. Turati gives his
attention to an opinion of Dr. Lelorrain, who says that we must modify man if we wish
to make criminality disappear or decrease. Dr. Turati objects that it is exceedingly
difficult to change man, and that there is an easier and more effective way, namely
to change society. In a society where everything is bad, where the exploitation of
one by the other is the rule, where the enjoyment of some goes on at the detriment
of others, and this under the protection of the law—in such a society there is a perpetual
incitement to crime. It is the ideal of socialism to create a society in which crime
shall be neither necessary nor advantageous. However short its duration, the colony
of New Lanark founded by Owen, is one of the best proofs of the correctness of this
idea. In a society formed in accordance with this socialistic ideal, crime would appear
only exceptionally, by atavism, for example, and would cease to be a general and always
threatening danger.
</p>
<p>“The social penal question is a question above all of social transformation.” Many
objections have been made to this statement. The school of Lombroso and Ferri sets
up in opposition its theory of the triplex character of the factors of crime; cosmic,
individual, and social. When society is so modified that the interests of the individual
are identical with those of the community, it would be only one part of crime that
would disappear; one could not, for example, prevent an extraordinary heat from causing
crimes against morals.
</p>
<p>According to Dr. Turati it is not impossible to refute this objection, though it may
be difficult to do so. In the first place Ferri recognizes the social causes as more
important than the other two put together. He estimates that the number of persons
driven to crime by social reasons (passion and occasion) is more than 60%; the others
(insane or half-insane criminals, born-incorrigibles, and habituals) form a minority,
then. But among these there are many criminals by habit, who were not born as such,
but have become such from force of circumstances. Dr. Turati estimates that from 70%
to 75% of criminals have come to commit their crimes from social causes. When we take
account further of the fact that about 18% of the prisoners are insane, the number
of real criminals who have become such from other than social causes is reduced to
10% at the most.
</p>
<p>According to Dr. Turati the physical and anthropological factors exert an influence
upon the form, but not upon the nature, of the crime. Further, these three causes
are present in every crime, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>almost no crime would be committed without the social cause. It is this last that
is always the predominant factor. When it is removed, then, the other two are reduced
to zero. The facts have proved this. Owen’s colony was not made up of peculiar material,
and the physical surroundings were neither better nor “more honest” than any other.
Nevertheless, crime was unknown there. But the author furnishes still further proofs
in support of his thesis that physical and anthropological causes amount to nothing
in comparison with social causes, which in turn are dependent upon economic conditions.
With the exception of crimes committed by the propertied class, which are in general
the result of excessive cupidity, or a commercial uneasiness, and which will “ipso
facto” disappear without any doubt when once society is otherwise organized, the greatest
contingent of criminals is furnished by the class of non-possessors. Now all the physical
influences, such as climate, act upon the two classes in the same way, nor are there
anthropological differences between the two classes, yet the difference between them
as regards criminal tendencies is great. It is the social factors, then, that explain
the difference.
</p>
<p>However, another observation must be made here. Ferri cites in a mass, as social factors,
the increase of population, emigration, public opinion, customs, etc. But when we
examine and classify these factors minutely, it becomes clear that in reality they
are based upon economic conditions alone.
</p>
<p>However, this observation is not applicable to “criminals by passion”, since in their
case the influence of the environment appears to be but weak. Lombroso estimates that
they form 5% of all criminals, and Ferri is of the opinion that it is only 5% of those
who commit crimes against persons who are criminals by passion.
</p>
<p>One of the anthropological causes of crime is “man”, and one of the cosmic causes
is “the universe.” But neither has anything to do with crime as such. Otherwise the
air we breathe and the food that we eat would be causes of crime. On the contrary,
it is the organization of society that is the cause of crime, and physical and anthropological
influences are only conditions. (Speaking scientifically we do not separate causes
and conditions, but this is the common usage.) If the causes ceased to exist the conditions
would have no further importance.
</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Turati treats of certain kinds of crime. First, <i>crimes against property</i>. As almost every criminologist will admit, these crimes are intimately connected
with the unequal division of property. “But,” an opponent will object, “it is not
possible, by means <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>of social institutions, to change cosmic influences, such as a low temperature, or
the failure of the crops, both of which cause an increase of the crimes against property.”
Those who are of this opinion forget, however, that a man does not become criminal
because he is cold, but he who is cold becomes criminal only if society neglects to
provide for the needs born of the cold.
</p>
<p>The influence of society is not seen so distinctly when <i>crimes against persons</i> are in question. Nevertheless it is very great; the economic conditions of our day
work in two ways, through poverty on the one side, and injustice on the other. Poverty
injures not only the physique but also the morals of a man, since it leaves him in
ignorance and grossness, and does not develop his moral sentiments. And then it is
harder to bear the evils caused by society than those caused by nature. In the second
place, economic inequality stifles the sense of justice in man, since it accustoms
him to this inequality. “The law is equal for all”, is only a phrase, for all are
not socially equal.
</p>
<p>One of the most wide-spread objections to the proposition that crimes spring from
social conditions is that if an improvement in these conditions leads to a decrease
of the crimes against property, the crimes against persons increase. This is urged
by Ferri, among others, as one of the most effective arguments against Turati and
his partisans. But against this may be urged another fact brought out by Ferri, namely
that while crime is increasing, it is becoming less intense and less brutal. We see
clearly, then, that it is possible to have a powerful counter-determinant to the tendency
to commit crimes against persons, <i>i.e.</i> education.
</p>
<p>As to <i>sexual crimes</i>, they increase when the food supply increases. This is the cause: sexual needs have
a direct relation to nutrition. An increase of the sexual needs, however, has nothing
to do with criminality. It is only the social organization that changes these needs
that have become more intense, into crimes, by subordinating the satisfaction of them
to economic considerations. There are, besides, other social causes, like bad housing
etc., that lead the proletariat to commit the crimes in question.
</p>
<p>The author then points out the enormous influence of the abuse of alcohol upon criminality,
the causes of this abuse being also found in the social organization.
</p>
<p>Another argument of Ferri’s must be refuted, <i>i.e.</i> that Turati and his followers attach too much weight to education. <i>Notwithstanding</i> the equality in the education of two brothers, says Ferri, one becomes a scamp and
the other a hero. To which the author replies that we <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>can say with just as good right, <i>thanks</i> to education the brother of a scamp becomes a hero.
</p>
<p>But in speaking of education Ferri has in mind that of the bourgeoisie, which is in
opposition to morality, and can consequently have but little influence. From the day
when the state of society shall have become sound, and the interests of all taken
to heart, morality can be in harmony with reality.
</p>
<p>“The true, all-inclusive penal substitute is the equal diffusion, so far as is socially
possible, of well-being and education, of the joys of love and thought.”

<h3 class="label">II.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">B. Battaglia.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before speaking of the influence of economic factors upon criminality, I feel obliged
to point out, by the following quotation, what the author of “<span lang="it">La dinamica del delitto</span>” understands by crime: “Primarily it must be noted that crime is not, in itself,
a phenomenon that assumes the criminal character from its own nature; but the criminal
character is affirmed or denied according to certain purely accessory circumstances
that accompany the act; and in all cases the crime is such with reference to social
relations.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17706src" href="#xd31e17706">3</a>
</p>
<p>“From the human point of view a crime represents the satisfaction of a need of the
criminal, like the satisfaction of any other need, and comes under the law of the
struggle for existence. In fact, a need not satisfied constitutes a pain, and pain,
whatever its nature be, first excites and then depresses and exhausts the functional
power of the organism. The organism, under the influence of pain, loses a quantity
of phosphates proportional to the intensity of the pain; the physiological equilibrium
is broken, and some functions important for the internal economy are neutralized.
The organism, because of the law of conservation, is called upon to relieve the pain.
Often it can do this without injury to others; at other times it comes into collision
with social interests, and in such a case falls into crime.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17711src" href="#xd31e17711">4</a>
</p>
<p>After having spoken of the anatomical and physiological characteristics that have
been observed in criminals, Dr. Battaglia comes to the investigation into the causes
that produce crime. In examining the factors of crime we see, according to the author,
that they consist of two great groups, first, <i>criminogenous factors</i>, and second, <i>occasional factors</i>. These last are important only when they are <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>present with the first. Among the occasional factors are to be classed in the first
place, age, meteorological occurrences, etc., in short, the influences to which the
whole population are subjected. In the second place, sex, economic conditions, education,
etc. <i>i.e.</i> influences which have a less universal sphere. However, none of the occasional factors
can, by itself, cause a crime to arise. Otherwise a whole population would be criminal
in the same way, since some factors, climate for instance, exercise their influence
upon the whole population. In order to lead to crime these factors must exert their
influence upon intellectual faculties especially disposed toward crime.
</p>
<p>The factors really criminogenous, are those which create certain physico-psychical
conditions, from the complexus of which results the personal capacity for crime, such
as the diseases and defects of development and nutrition, cranial and intracranial;
improper education; psychical heredity; and atavistic reversions.
</p>
<p>“When these factors have prepared the mental condition, by making it different from
that of all others, any opportunity whatever is a sufficient psychical factor, and
a crime is committed. Therefore the criminogenous factors are those that have the
real social importance, because they prepare inevitably for delinquency.
</p>
<p>“It is true, on the other hand, that any of the occasional factors, acting in a certain
way, and with a certain intensity and persistency, can produce criminogenous factors,
like education or alimentation.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17728src" href="#xd31e17728">5</a>
</p>
<p>The author then treats some of the so-called “occasional factors”, such as age, sex,
and religion. I shall speak only of what Dr. Battaglia says upon the influence of
alcoholism and poverty upon criminality, since this is pertinent to my work.
</p>
<p>Alcoholism is a cause of crime in two ways, first, direct, <i>i.e.</i> when crimes are committed under the actual influence of intoxication; second, indirect,
since chronic alcoholism causes demoralization and degeneracy. As evidence in support
of this the author cites the opinions of Baer, Virgilio, and others.
</p>
<p>As to poverty, Dr. Battaglia remarks that the opinion of Professor Lombroso on this
subject cannot be correct. The latter believes that the importance of the fact that
crimes against property decrease when prices fall, is weakened by the circumstance
that, according to Guerry, the theft of food holds only the hundredth place in the
table of articles stolen. According to Dr. Battaglia this has no weight in a critical
examination of the influence of poverty. For anyone who is driven to crime by hunger
tries by preference to seize articles that <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>are of great value and little volume, since he can at once exchange them for other
articles that are directly consumable. Further it must not be forgotten that alcoholism
and bad education are intimately connected with poverty, and lead in their turn to
crime. Not only does acute hunger incite to theft indirectly, it may lead to it directly,
for it may (according to Professor Follet) bring on a delirium. Chronic hunger and
malnutrition may cause pellagra, rachitis, tuberculosis, scrofula, etc., or predispose
to these diseases, which may cause crime in their turn.
</p>
<p>In the second part of “<span lang="it">La dinamica del delitto</span>” the author makes an examination of what he has called the “criminogenous factors.”
Crime is a phenomenon that develops itself in society in accordance with certain constant
laws. Consequently the criminogenous factors must be found in society. To discover
them, then, it is necessary to examine the different social institutions.
</p>
<p><i>The family.</i> In nature and in primitive society there rules a natural selection by which the weak
and sickly are prevented from reproducing themselves, or from reproducing themselves
as freely as those who are stronger. But at present this selection is no longer felt;
even the most wretched, the most diseased can procreate, since it happens constantly
that marriages take place with a secondary object. Hence transmission of degeneracy
may go on from one generation to another, and consequently, the indirect propagation
of crime.
</p>
<p><i>The social position of woman.</i> The inferior position in which woman finds herself in general (the cause of this
is in social conditions, since the position of woman varies among different people)
occasions crimes in different ways. First, since woman takes no part in the public
life, she is circumscribed in intellect, and consequently, vain, egoistic, and ignorant.
It follows that her influence upon her children is often very bad. Then, because of
her inferior position she easily becomes the victim of unscrupulous men, who seduce
her, so that she is often driven to prostitution. In consequence of her ignorance
she often marries a man who has asked for her in marriage with an interested motive.
Further, her manner of living (lack of healthful work, etc.) may bring on neuroses
that are transmissible to her children.
</p>
<p><i>Human reproduction.</i> As an animal, man must satisfy two predominant necessities, that of feeding himself,
and that of procreating. Though this last is not as strong as the other, it must nevertheless
be satisfied, and without this the human organism would experience very painful consequences.
Celibacy is very harmful to morality; it leads to prostitution (with its consequences,
like syphilis), to misconduct, <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>and hence to the abuse of alcohol, etc.—in short, it favors the birth of anti-social
sentiments.
</p>
<p>The present laws governing the relations between man and woman are also harmful to
morality. The author here refers to the indissolubility of marriage. When the motive
for a marriage has ceased to exist, namely when mutual love no longer exists, the
marriage ought to be dissolved. The harmful consequences of this indissolubility are
numerous. Adultery and many homicides flow from it; the education of children suffers
from it enormously; and finally if the mother expects a child, the vexation consequent
upon discord may exercise an unfavorable influence upon the newly born.
</p>
<p><i>Education.</i> The development of the intellect and especially of the feelings is of the highest
importance to morality. For example, where a disagreement will be settled in an amicable
manner among persons who are well brought up, the same disagreement among persons
ill-trained will often lead to brawls. Education is a very complex and difficult task,
requiring much tact and knowledge. It is not astonishing that as practised it leaves
much to be desired. And the consequences of this absence of a good education are exceedingly
favorable to the development of criminality. However, it must not be forgotten that
some persons, in consequence of qualities transmitted by heredity, become immoral
despite the best imaginable education. The answer to the question “should education
be left to the parents, <i>i.e.</i> to private persons, who can consequently corrupt their pupils entirely, and not be
under public control?” must, according to Dr. Battaglia, be absolutely negative. In
order that education may be effective in the family it must be supplemented by the
moral influence of the environment, which also plays an important part in the education
of the child. The great congestion of persons in the cities, for example, should disappear,
because of its bad influence.
</p>
<p><i>Instruction.</i> The double end of instruction is in the first place to strengthen the intellect by
exercising it, from which it will result that it will have a greater power over the
feelings; and in the second place to furnish a certain amount of positive knowledge,
by which the individual is put into a position to adapt himself to his environment
and to foresee the consequences of his acts. From this it follows that instruction
is of great importance in dealing with criminality. Those who deny this mean by the
“instructed man” one who has learned to read and write; but it is evident that such
instruction is not enough to exercise an influence of any real importance. It is undeniable
that persons well reared may also become criminals, but in every case their <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>crimes have a less ferocious character than those of persons without education.
</p>
<p><i>Religion and State.</i> Religion is opposed to progress, to the development of the faculties, and to the
general dissemination of knowledge that improves men and increases solidarity; and
it incites to intolerance. Further, the confessional instruction is harmful to the
intellectual faculties of children. The state puts obstacles in the way of the free
movements of individuals; maintains civil marriage; prevents free discussion, one
of the primary requirements for progress; it sets up compulsory education, but does
not prevent the population’s being brought up in error; by drafting great armies,
it withdraws the best forces from agriculture and manufacturing, so that the vigorous
individuals marry late, and prostitution is thereby encouraged; it tolerates stock
exchanges and lotteries; it favors crowding into great cities, something that is very
favorable, directly and indirectly, to crime (bad housing conditions, alcoholism,
etc.).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In the chapter that follows, Professor Battaglia reduces the factors that he has just
named “criminogenous”, to economic elements. “All the inconveniences, the anomalies,
the errors, the disorders, found in the family, in the state, in social and religious
relationships, etc., are provoked by the economic situation in which society finds
itself.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17775src" href="#xd31e17775">6</a>
</p>
<p><i>Civil Status.</i> In the communistic villages of Russia it is advantageous for the father of a family
to have many children, for the work in the common fields is then performed more easily.
Hence the marriages of persons less than 20 years old are numerous. In the rest of
Europe the situation is entirely different. By marrying, a man makes himself worse
off, and at the birth of each child his cares increase. Hence marriages are put off
(especially among professional men) when the man cannot provide for the needs of his
family. For analogous reasons some deny their sexual desires and contract a marriage
to better their position. In both cases economic conditions exercise an unfavorable
influence. When his income is not sufficient to support himself and his family properly,
the workman is obliged to labor longer than his strength permits; he and his family
are not well enough fed, their dwelling is bad; consequently their physical condition
deteriorates. The effects are not only diseases, like scrofula, pellagra, phthisis,
anemia, etc., but also a great predisposition to contract them. Poverty undermines
the organism and exhausts its strength.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>In consequence of present economic conditions it is possible to amass enormous wealth;
but wants are still further increased relatively, which brings it about that frauds,
embezzlements, etc., are often committed by persons of means, especially since the
moral sentiments are lost when one thinks only of gaining money. But wealth is inconstant;
he who has plenty today may be very poor tomorrow. This is what causes the disquiet
and agitation that characterizes the bourgeoisie, and the neuroses that often follow.
Finally the author dwells upon the work of women and children, so harmful to morality
and to health.
</p>
<p><i>Alcoholism.</i> The inevitable consequence of poverty is the abuse of alcoholic drinks. One who works
too much and eats too little, who is badly housed and ill-clad, and has no intellectual
occupation, finds in alcohol a means of forgetting his poverty. The life led by a
great part of the bourgeoisie leads also to alcoholism. The harmful consequences of
alcoholism are numerous, especially as regards criminality, because, first, it leads
directly to violent crimes, and, secondly, it indirectly favors degeneracy.
</p>
<p><i>Fatherhood.</i> It is only for economic reasons that legal marriage, its indissolubility, and all
that belongs to it, are maintained. If each of the parents kept his or her economic
independence, there would be no reason to take up the matter of legal regulation,
and thus the question of whether the father of the child is or is not the legal husband
of the mother would no longer concern the State.
</p>
<p><i>Prostitution.</i> Most prostitutes come from the lower strata of society. Like the criminals they present
signs of degeneracy, and from the sole fact of degeneracy have taken on larger proportions
in the proletariat than in the other classes, though the chance that these women will
recruit themselves in this class is already greater. The other causes of prostitution
are of an economic nature, such as exploitation by parents, bad housing, etc. In consequence
of prostitution syphilis spreads and in its turn favors degeneracy. Further, from
the weakening of their moral sentiments prostitutes are more easily led to commit
crimes.
</p>
<p><i>Ignorance.</i> The cause of the great ignorance of the working-people—an important factor in criminality—is
of an economic nature. The workers have to exhaust their strength, and have neither
the leisure nor the means, for mental development.
</p>
<p><i>Laxity of morals.</i> In indigent families all the members sleep in one room, often even in one bed. Hence
it comes that sexual morality is lacking. The parents, often absent on account of
their work, <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>leave their children to their fate. These latter do not know how to look after themselves,
and easily learn bad habits from other children. The education of the children of
the bourgeoisie is no more favorable. Often they learn only that they must make money,
or acquire a social position, or make a “good” marriage, a thing which leads them
to all sorts of deceits and intrigues to arrive at their end.
</p>
<p><i>Plutocracy.</i> The great armaments and wars of European powers are the consequence of the present
system of competition, which obliges the constant search for new outlets for commerce.
</p>
<p><i>Plutocracy of the Church.</i> It is only upon its economic resources that the great power of the Church rests.
</p>
<p><i>Corollary.</i> Poverty alone causes many moral situations from which crime must logically result.
The majority of criminals are in fact recruited among the less privileged classes.
</p>
<p>But the bourgeoisie is not happy simply because the proletariat is unhappy. The cause
of the unhappiness of both is in the present economic conditions, by which the great
majority of the population vegetate in the blackest misery, while the others are immersed
in idle luxury. There is only one remedy for this injustice; it is to divide the total
product of labor among the workers, and not among the capitalists.

<h3 class="label">III.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">N. Colajanni.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The whole of the first volume and the first chapters of the second volume of “<span lang="it">La sociologia criminale</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17822src" href="#xd31e17822">7</a> contain a criticism of the theses of the Italian school. The author denies the correctness
of these, since he believes that we must consider the anthropological and physical
causes as having little or no importance. This he demonstrates in detail. In his last
chapters Dr. Colajanni treats of social and economic factors.
</p>
<p>While admitting that economic conditions are of the highest importance in the development
of the whole social life, and consequently in the matter of criminality, the author
does not agree with Marx and Loria, who consider every social occurrence, whether
political, or religious, or æsthetic, or moral, as the unique and direct product of
an economic phenomenon.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17833src" href="#xd31e17833">8</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to the author, this assertion is carried too far, since the feelings and
passions of superior people, who do not think of material profits, influence the masses
at certain moments.
</p>
<p>A great number of philosophers, moralists, poets, statisticians, and economists have
seen in economic conditions the “<span lang="la">causa causarum</span>” of morality, and consequently also of crime. Pietro Ellero, among others, says very
decisively: “From private property are derived all crimes, or almost all. Property
engenders cupidity and haughtiness on the one side and depravity on the other, even
when it does not produce the perfect tyranny of the one class and the degradation
of the other. It is the cause of most of the evil passions, faults, and crimes that
are committed, of the troubles, anxieties, sadness, and rancor from which both rich
and poor suffer alike. The immoral influence of property is continued afterwards,
and that terribly, in the present organization of the family, constructed, as it is,
almost always upon the basis of calculation!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17843src" href="#xd31e17843">9</a>
</p>
<p>It is incontestable that economic conditions have a direct influence upon the origin
of crime. The lack of the means of satisfying the numerous wants of a man is already
a goad to incite him to procure these means in any way whatever, honest or dishonest.
And it is the dishonest way that one will choose by preference when society makes
it difficult or impossible to act otherwise. A London pickpocket gets $1500 a year
on the average; on the other hand, the misery of those who wish to earn their living
honestly is indescribable. Further, the honest man’s chance of being killed or becoming
incapable of working is greater than the thief’s chance of being punished. Honest
work results in fewer advantages and more dangers than dishonest work.
</p>
<p>The <i>indirect</i> influence is not less important than the direct. War, our present industry, the family,
marriage, political institutions, revolutions, vagrancy, prostitution, education,
etc. are important causes of crime, but they can all be reduced to economic causes.
According to many persons education is the one means of preventing moral evils, but
John Stuart Mill has already said: in our present society the poor have no education,
and that of the rich is bad. There is no possibility of a good education if a certain
material well-being is lacking. Hence those who expect everything from education under
the present conditions are wrong.
</p>
<p>But where does well-being cease and poverty begin? Both are only relative conceptions;
consequently we cannot fix their limits. <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>In order to attain the minimum of criminality in any given society there must be the
<i>certainty</i> of the means of subsistence, <i>stability</i> of economic conditions, and <i>equality</i> in the distribution of wealth.
</p>
<p>Some authors deny that political revolutions have their causes in economic conditions.
Lombroso and Laschi, for example, attempt to explain them chiefly by physical influences;
which is the more astonishing, because in the general opinion it is from economic
causes that they are derived. They adduce, among other things, to support their opinion,
the fact that out of 147 revolts that took place in Europe between 1793 and 1880,
only a third were attributable to economic conditions. It goes without saying that
this does not at all prove the correctness of their thesis, since in all these cases
the authors are speaking only of direct causes, while most military revolutions, revolts
against the royal power, etc., spring from economic conditions, even if indirectly.
It is true that in the 19th century the direct revolutionary influence of crises and
famines has decreased, because of the measures taken by the governments. This does
not however prevent there having been revolts occasioned by such conditions (Lyons
in 1831, etc.). The frequent revolts in Belgium and France, rich countries, do not
furnish any proof against the thesis of Dr. Colajanni; for notwithstanding the great
wealth of these countries, nothing proves that it is equally divided. As soon as the
poverty of a people has passed certain limits, we see in that country neither crimes,
revolutions, nor suicides, since all energy is then extinct.
</p>
<p>Another question is this: how far is there a correlation between <i>the progress made by socialism</i> and the increase of criminality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17866src" href="#xd31e17866">10</a> Several authors, like Garofalo, are of the opinion that there is an intimate connection
between the two. But they do not furnish any facts as proofs in support of their assertion,
to which, on the contrary, the facts give the lie.
</p>
<p>The countries where socialism is most widely spread do not show the greatest criminality;
rather the contrary. The German and Italian districts where there are the most socialists
are no longer the most criminal. How could it be otherwise? While socialism is the
conscious and collective reaction against the existing order, crime is the unconscious
and individual reaction against that order.
</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Colajanni turns his attention to <i>idleness and vagrancy</i>, which are both causes of crime. Out of 32,943 thefts in Paris in 1882, 57% were
committed by vagrants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>But are idleness and vagrancy considered in themselves also offenses? Any man is harmful
to his species, says Féré, when he does not collaborate, either materially or intellectually,
in production. According to Dr. Colajanni, idleness and vagrancy, viewed from such
a high social point of view, are really offenses. But then the idle rich are also
guilty of these offenses. Finally, what are the causes of these crimes? Spencer, Féré,
and Sergi say: the vagrants are the weak, the degenerate, the parasites of society.
The question is this, then: do these phenomena find their origin inside or outside
of the human organism? Romagnosi says that vagrancy and idleness ought to be punished
only when they are not excusable. To make them inexcusable it would be necessary to
procure employment for every man who was willing to work. Spencer, Sergi, and Garofalo,
on the contrary, are of the opinion that these crimes are almost always to be imputed
to the same persons. However, Spencer should not have forgotten that in his own country,
aside from industrial crises, numerous occurrences have forced a great number of persons
to become idlers and vagrants through no fault of their own, as for example, the Irish
and Scotch farmers driven from their lands by the landlords.
</p>
<p>And Garofalo should have known that it is capitalism that has made the work of men
superfluous by employing women and children, and that the cause does not rest with
those who suffer from it; on the contrary, the cause of economic crises is not in
their victims, but in the system that is in force.
</p>
<p>An examination of the causes of these two phenomena obliges us to distinguish between
habitual and accidental, or forced, vagrancy. However—and this is too often forgotten—the
latter transforms itself into the former, for the taste for work is, like morality,
an acquired social product. This is why this quality is lost when one is long without
work.
</p>
<p>One of the most important causes of the possible transformation of a worker into a
vagrant is a long illness. Having lost the habit of work, and being enfeebled, a man
will find great difficulty in going to work again. If he does not succeed he descends
step by step until he comes finally to mendicity. But it is chiefly the economic transformations,
inventions, overproduction, that must be called the “<span lang="la">causa causarum</span>” of the phenomena cited above.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17884src" href="#xd31e17884">11</a>
</p>
<p><i>Prostitution</i>, which occupies so important a place in the etiology of <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>crime, in almost every case finds its origin in poverty, in a bad education, in a
corrupting environment, as is proved by the official investigations and the writings
of specialists, like Parent-Duchatelet, Fiaux, <span class="corr" id="xd31e17892" title="Source: Agagneur">Augagneur</span>, and many others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17895src" href="#xd31e17895">12</a>
</p>
<p>The correlation that exists between crimes against property and economic conditions
is very evident, and is direct. This causality appears also with regard to crimes
against persons. Only it is then indirect. The influence of poverty upon criminality
is especially great when it has been of long duration. Proudhon is quite right when
he says: “Hunger that is every instant present, during the whole year, during the
whole life, hunger which does not kill in a day, but is composed of all deprivations
and all griefs, and unceasingly consumes the body, ruins the spirit, demoralizes the
conscience, corrupts the race, generates all vices and diseases (drunkenness, among
others), and an aversion towards work and thrift, baseness of spirit, callousness
of conscience, laziness, and prostitution together with theft.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e17900src" href="#xd31e17900">13</a>
</p>
<p>The fact that the number of thefts of provisions is relatively small has little importance,
since the thief always tries to steal some article of small bulk and great value.
Also it must not be forgotten that little thefts of food often pass unnoticed, or
without complaint being made, because the party injured does not consider the act
a crime, since committed from necessity.
</p>
<p>Another convincing proof of the influence of economic conditions is the incontestable
fact that it continually happens that a person will declare himself guilty of a crime
that has not been committed, with the sole purpose of obtaining a lodging in jail.
The great percentage made up of crimes committed from cupidity, as well as the fact
that the number of recidivists is greater for crimes against property than for others,
shows the great influence of economic conditions.
</p>
<p>The study of the <i>morality of primitive peoples</i> shows us that the crimes of abortion, for example, of infanticide, and homicide upon
the aged, have their origin in economic conditions exclusively, the means of subsistence
not being sufficient to support a large population. When these crimes occur among
civilized peoples they have the same causes. For example, cases of infanticide are
very common in Trevise, one of the poorest provinces in Italy. The lack of education
or the influence of other factors opposed to education are the reason why the corrupting
influence of which we have been speaking often rages in the lower classes with all
its force.
</p>
<p>To prove the assertion that economic conditions have little influence <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>upon criminality, some authors cite the fact that England, with its great wealth,
shows a greater number of crimes against property than Italy, which is much poorer.
He who reasons in this way forgets that the absolute wealth of a country may be very
great, but the distribution of that wealth not proportional. England gives us the
proof of this; in no other country is the difference between rich and poor more pronounced,
and without the presence of other important and opposing factors, the criminality
would be much greater than it is now.
</p>
<p>One might also bring up the difference between the criminality of Ireland, which is
smaller despite the proverbial poverty there, and the great criminality of Italy.
However, when we study conditions in the two countries we find that those in Italy
are still more undesirable than those in Ireland, which explains the greater criminality
against property in Italy. The mysterious assassinations of large landholders and
their agents in Ireland have also their cause in the bad distribution of the land.
In Belgium criminality is greatest where well-being is least (in Flanders). According
to the researches of Liszt and Starcke, the poorest districts of Germany are also
those that are most criminal, etc.
</p>
<p>Upon the <i>economic condition of criminals</i> the author gives the following data: In 1870–71 there were among the prisoners at
Neufchâtel 10% who had some property, and 89% who had only their work for their support
(in the non-criminal population the percentage of these is much smaller). According
to the data of Stevens the prisoners in Belgium were divided as follows: 1% of well-to-do
persons, 11% of persons with some income, and 88% of indigent persons.

<p>At the time that they committed their crimes 43% of these criminals in general, and
more than 50% of the criminals against property were without work.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>All that has been given above has to do with <i>statics</i>; what follows has to do with dynamics. The rule universally observed is this: modifications
in economic conditions are followed by modifications in criminality. When the former
grow worse, the number of crimes (and especially of those against property) increases,
and vice versa. It is especially the proletariat, who have no means of resisting the
unfavorable influence of crises, a rise in the price of food, etc., who are hardest
hit in these cases.
</p>
<p>The author gives some data. In Italy in 1880 a great increase of crime coincided with
a lack of work and with a rise in the price of provisions. The gradual diminution
in criminality must be attributed to the good harvest and the large emigration. In
Belgium the number of prisoners rose during the crisis of 1846 from 6750 to 9884.
In Norway, in consequence of the depression of 1869, crimes against property reached
the maximum. The number of prisoners in Sweden rose from 1835 to 1839, chiefly because
of poverty, from 12,799 to 18,357. A great increase in crime took place in England
in consequence of the crises of 1826, 1830, 1847, and others. In the United States
there were in 1884 not less than 400,000 working-men without work, which explains
the following figures:

<p>In consequence of the economic crises of 1839, 1840, 1843, 1847, 1867, 1876, and 1881,
the number of murders increased in France.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18077src" href="#xd31e18077">14</a>
</p>
<p><i>The maximum stability and the minimum lack of proportion in the distribution of wealth</i> is the best preservative against crime. The correctness of this rule is proved by
the facts. The small number of crimes among the Irish is explained by their altruistic
sentiments, which are the consequence of their social institutions from before the
conquest of their country by the English. Among Mohammedans <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>crime is rare. Also there may be remarked among them a true democracy, based upon
equality and fraternity. The Yorubas (in Eastern Africa) have a mild character, and
they are benevolent and true to their word; with them the land is considered as common
property, etc., etc.
</p>
<p>“These are facts which speak clearly: the collectivism of the Javanese <i>dessa</i>, of the Berber <i>diema</i>, the Russian <i>mir</i>, the Slav <i>zadrouga</i>, and the village community of the early Aryans and North American Indians, produces
everywhere, with all climates, among all races, identically the same results—morality
and solidarity.
</p>
<p>“It is to be noted also, that everywhere and at all times, whether in the temperate
or the frigid zone, in the North, in the South, or at the equator, laws and institutions
which aim to insure certainty of subsistence and to maintain a certain equality, go
far to cut down crime; and they do it in such a way as to make those who live under
them more moral than those who are subject to different institutions and laws. We
have clear examples of this among the Hebrews, Iroquois, Peruvians, Chinese, Berbers,
etc., although they differ greatly as to the grade of civilization they have reached.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18098src" href="#xd31e18098">15</a>

<p class="first">In “<span lang="de">Die Frau und der <span class="corr" id="xd31e18111" title="Source: Socialismus">Sozialismus</span></span>” the author gives the following pages to the relation between the present social
organization and crime: “The increase of crime of every description is intimately
connected with the social conditions of the community, little as the latter is inclined
to believe it. Society hides its head in the sand, like the ostrich, in order not
to be forced to recognize a state of things that bears witness against it, and silences
its own conscience and others’ with the lying pretense that laziness and love of pleasure
on the part of the workmen and their want of religion is accountable for everything.
This is hypocrisy of the most revolting kind. The more unfavorable and depressed the
condition of society, the more numerous and grave do crimes become. The struggle for
existence then assumes its most brutal and violent shape, it throws man back into
his primæval state, in which each regarded the other as his deadly enemy. The ties
of solidarity, not too firm at the best of times, become daily looser.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The ruling classes, who do not and will not recognize the causes of things, attempt
to effect a change by employing force against the products of these conditions, and
even men whom we should expect to be enlightened and free from prejudice, are ready
to support the system. Professor Haeckel, for instance, regards the stringent application
of capital punishment as desirable, and harmonizes in this point with the reactionaries
of every shade, who on all other subjects are his bitterest enemies. According to
his theory, hopeless criminals and ne’er-do-wells must be rooted out like weeds, which
deprive the more valuable plants of light, air, and soil. If Professor Haeckel had
occupied himself even to a slight degree with the study of social science, instead
of limiting himself to natural science, he would have discovered that all these criminals
could be transformed into useful, valuable members of society, if society offered
them more favorable means of existence. He would have found that the annihilation
of the criminal has just as little effect on crime, <i>i.e.</i> on the development of fresh crimes, as if on a number of farms the ground were superficially
cleared of weeds while the roots and seeds remained undestroyed. Man will never be
able absolutely to prevent the development of noxious organisms in nature, but it
is unquestionably within his power so to improve the social organism created by himself,
that it may afford equally favorable conditions of existence and an equal freedom
of growth to all; that no one may be forced to gratify his hunger or his desire of
possession or his ambition at the expense of someone else. People only need to investigate
the causes of crime and to remove them, and they will abolish crime itself.
</p>
<p>“Naturally those who seek to abolish crime by abolishing its causes cannot take kindly
to measures of brutal suppression. They cannot prevent society from protecting itself
against crime in its own way, but they demand all the more urgently the radical reformation
of society, <i>i.e.</i> the removal of causes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18123src" href="#xd31e18123">16</a>
</p>
<p>“The relationship between social conditions and crime has often been pointed out by
statisticians and sociologists. One of the offenses that comes closest to us—for our
society, in spite of all the Christian teaching about charity, regards it as a crime—in
times of business depression, is mendicity. We learn from the statistics of the kingdom
of Saxony, that in measure as the last great commercial <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>crisis grew worse, beginning in Germany in 1890 with the end not yet in sight, the
number of persons sentenced for mendicity also increased. In 1889, in the Kingdom
of Saxony 8566 persons were punished for this offense, 8815 in 1890, 10,075 in 1891,
and in 1892 as many as 13,120, a very great increase. The impoverishment of the masses
on the one hand, with increasing wealth on the other, is the chief mark of our period.
In 1874 there was one poor man to 724 persons, while in 1882 the number had reached
1 to 622.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18137src" href="#xd31e18137">17</a> Crimes and misdemeanors show a similar tendency. In 1874, there were 308,605 persons
sentenced in Austria-Hungary, and 600,000 in 1892. In the German Empire in 1882 there
were 329,968 persons sentenced for crimes and misdemeanors against the laws, <i>i.e.</i> 103.2 persons to 10,000 of the population over 12 years old; in 1892 the number of
those sentenced reached 422,327, or 143.3 to the 10,000, an increase of 39%. Those
convicted of crimes and misdemeanors against property were:

<p class="first">The first part of the study, “<span lang="de">Die Kriminalität in Frankreich von 1840–1886</span>”, is taken up with an examination of the trend of criminality during these years.
The author comes to the conclusion that during this period crime has increased, and
that the line that shows this increase is made up of a succession of curves, alternately
concave and convex.
</p>
<p>In the second part, he treats of the causes of crime. He first points out that the
belief that the proclamation of liberty, equality, and fraternity in the French Revolution
would be speedily followed by a diminution in crime, was not borne out by the facts.
Then he takes up the idea, so widespread in the first half of the 19th century, that
one of the most important causes of criminality is the lack of education. This hypothesis
has been generally recognized as false, <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>in consequence of an examination of the facts. According to Lafargue, who is entirely
in agreement with Quetelet on this point, it is necessary not only to examine the
qualities of the individual, but also especially to analyze society, and to try thus
to discover the sources of crime. Next the author shows the results of the researches
of Quetelet with regard to the influence of the season, age, and sex upon criminality,
and sets forth and criticises briefly the theories of Lombroso and his partisans with
regard to the criminal man. We should run to too great length if we gave more fully
his refutation which is as brilliant as it is accurate.
</p>
<p>Some statisticians connect the returns of the harvests and vintages with criminality.
An investigation upon this point as regards France, gives the following results: the
years 1847, 1854, 1868, and 1874, which are characterized by a great increase of crime,
were preceded by years of bad harvests.

<p>However, the bad harvests of 1855, 1861, and 1879 did not have these results, and
with the good crops of 1847 to 1852 crime increased. Here there were, therefore, other
factors. Consequently, although the price of grain can partially explain the fluctuations
of criminality, it does not account for the general increase from 1840 to 1886.
</p>
<p>The author combats further the opinion of Professor Lacassagne that crimes against
persons are especially under the influence of the production and consumption of wine.
If this were the case the wine-growing departments ought to furnish the highest figure
for crimes against persons, which is not the case. On the contrary, Lafargue is of
the opinion that in this respect, the consumption of brandy is of more importance.
The continually increasing abuse of alcohol (<i>i.e.</i> of spirituous drinks like brandy) which in its turn is due to the miserable condition
of the proletariat, is one of the causes of the increasing criminality.

<p>In the third part Lafargue makes special investigations with regard to the correlation
between economic conditions and criminality. If the theory of Lombroso were correct,
criminality ought to decrease; bad harvests no longer explain the increase, and the
climate has not changed. However, the increase of criminality coincided with the enormous
increase in the productive forces in France.

<p>There is a close correspondence, then, between the development of the economic forces
and the increase of criminality. Must we regard this as simply chance, or is there
causality between the two? Quetelet has already pointed out that the poorest districts,
<i>i.e.</i> those in which the absolute wealth is not great, but where the contrasts are not
very marked, furnish fewer criminals than the wealthier provinces. According to Lafargue
this has become still more striking with the development of capitalism.
</p>
<p>“The colossal development of the productive forces and the national wealth does not
lead to the increase of the well-being of all the members of society, but to enormous
fortunes on the one hand, and on the other to misery and need, for the great majority
of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>population.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18418src" href="#xd31e18418">19</a> If the multiplying, grading, and perfecting of punishments have been incapable of
checking the upward progress of crime, this proves that crimes and misdemeanors against
the common law are the necessary products of conditions, and are closely bound up
with the form and fashion of the creation of social wealth in capitalistic society.
</p>
<p>“The development of the capitalistic mode of production is not uniform; at times it
is over-rapid, and then slows up again and undergoes crises that destroy the living
of thousands and millions of individuals. If it is correct that modern criminality
is a necessary consequence of the method of the production of wealth in capitalistic
society, then the fluctuations of crime must correspond with the variations in production.
The number of offenses must increase in times of crisis, and decrease when economic
conditions improve; in other words, criminality is determined by the flourishing or
depression of the capitalistic mode of production.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18423src" href="#xd31e18423">20</a>
</p>
<p>As a means of measuring comparative economic conditions, Lafargue has taken the annual
number of failures. He has also traced a curve for the price of flour.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18428src" href="#xd31e18428">21</a>
</p>
<p>Examining the first plate we see that lines I and II, although not entirely parallel
with V, follow it in general. According to Lafargue there are three counter-determinants
that caused the deviations: first, changes in the price of flour; second, political
events; third, extraordinary industrial activity. Thus, for example, it was the political
events of 1848–52 that prevented the decrease of crime during those years, though
the failures and the price of flour went down; and at the close of 1854 a feverish
economic development recommenced, which, with the fall of the price of flour in 1856–59,
caused a decrease of criminality during those years. At the same time the failures
rose a little; but the line would doubtless show a different course if it were drawn
with reference to the ratio of failures to the total number of commercial and industrial
enterprises in this period. The low price of flour in 1869 neutralized the increase
of failures and even diminished the criminality. From 1874 to 1878 a new industrial
revival kept crime stationary or reduced it. Since 1876 the failures have increased
greatly and crime follows at a little interval; the falling price of grain (1881–1885)
certainly exerted an influence.

</p>
<p>Vagrancy and mendicity take the same course as failures; they increase, however, from
1848 to 1852 in consequence of the political troubles of those years. From 1878 on,
failures, and vagrancy and mendicity increase and are parallel. In the periods of
industrial revival (1854–59 and 1874–76) vagrancy and mendicity decline sharply. In
examining the curve of recidivism it must be remembered that since 1884 many recidivists
have been transported.

<p>At the end of his study the author comes to the following conclusion: “The effect
of bankruptcy upon criminality and politics is undeniable; it furnishes one of the
most striking proofs of the correctness of the historical theory of Karl Marx, that
the phenomena of literature and art, of morality and religion, of philosophy and politics,
in human society, lead back to the phenomena of economic development.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18478src" href="#xd31e18478">23</a>

“<span lang="fr">La criminalité et la crise économique</span>”, by calling attention to the effect that the crisis of 1846–47 had upon criminality.
The crops of wheat, rye, and especially potatoes had been bad, and the price of these
articles of food had accordingly risen. The breaking up of household labor and the
introduction of machines brought about a revolution in the linen industry at the same
time. So the figures for crime indicate an enormous increase during these years, and

<p>Then the author treats of the effect produced upon criminality by the crises of 1874
and the years following. The price of grain no longer giving, in consequence of importation,
an exact picture of the economic conditions, he adds to the chart which he uses, the
“<span lang="fr">nombres indicateurs</span>” (of 28 of the more important articles of commerce). The curve of these numbers shows
a fluctuating rise during the period from 1850 to 1865, and a fluctuating decline
during the period following the years 1874–75. During the first period, in which the
economic conditions were favorable (the years 1870 to 1873 being characterized by
an economic development that was even feverish), criminality remained fairly stationary.
Only during the years 1856–57 and 1861–62 was there an increase, and this is probably
to be ascribed to the high price of grain. The economic depression that commenced
after 1874 was severely felt, and crime continually increased without the low price
of grain being able to prevent it.
</p>
<p>Professor Denis closes his report with the following words: “The solution of the problem
of criminality must be in part sought in economic conditions; and the more regular
and constant the social movement of wealth, the more we approach a normal equilibrium
of collective functions, the more we instil justice into our economic institutions,
the more shall we be able to gain the mastery over criminality.
</p>
<p>“An Italian criminologist, Ferri, studying the evolution of criminality in France
in relation to the income of the most numerous class, has shown that with a general
rise in wages we see a decrease in certain kinds of crime. The general increase of
prosperity is a sure pledge of a decrease in criminality. But there is another, and
that is a decrease in those more or less marked oscillations, in the economic world,
whose periodic return is certainly one of the gravest aspects of the modern state.
</p>
<p>“In the second place, the economic causes that affect the tendency to crime reveal
an immense solidarity, which continues to extend <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>itself into space, as heredity plunges its roots into time. The great fluctuations
in prices are common to the whole world, and the individual whom these perturbations
drive to crime by a series of shocks, comes into conflict with a great number of other
individuals, without being conscious of this infinite solidarity. But science must
endeavor to collect the evidence of it. Finally these great economic influences tend,
on the one hand, to reduce the field of the individual responsibility, and on the
other, to give a precise character to the responsibility of society in this connection.
It is responsible, in fact, within the limits within which it might have restrained
the economic fluctuations and corrected their effects, but has not done so. Here the
terrible saying of Quetelet is still true: society herself has put the weapon into
the hand of the criminal.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18563src" href="#xd31e18563">24</a>

<p class="first">In the chapter, “<span lang="de">Die degenerirenden Einwirkungen des Kapitalismus</span>”, this author treats of the question of criminality and its relation with present
economic conditions.
</p>
<p>“The property-holders, those who enjoy the benefits of all the political and social
institutions, alone have the right to exist. Those without possessions do not have
this right, despite the fiction of the Prussian code with regard to the matter. The
simple instinct of self-preservation causes them to engage in a continual attack upon
a legal system that protects only the stronger. It is this attack which those who
are in possession of power, those who have drawn up the laws for the purpose of protecting
their power, characterize as a breach of the law, as crime.… This is the simplest
relationship between the form of society and crime. Naturally, complications come
in.… The stronger those without property, the outlawed, themselves become through
some chance, the more do they modify the law that was set up by those who were formerly
stronger, the more do complications arise in the primitively simple right of property,
the right to the protection of social institutions, and the law of marriage, and the
greater and more complicated becomes the circle of crimes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18601src" href="#xd31e18601">26</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>After having next spoken briefly of free will, and having shown that it is incorrect
to connect criminality with a single social phenomenon alone, since the social mechanism
is too complicated, the author begins to treat of the <i>crimes against property</i>. In the first place he gives the following tables:

<p>Finally, Dr. Lux cites some statistics from Kolb’s “<span lang="de">Handbuch <span class="corr" id="xd31e18896" title="Source: ver">der</span> vergleichenden Statistik</span>”, which show the close connection between crimes against property and economic conditions.
</p>
<p><i>Political crimes.</i> “In the case of crimes against the State, public order, and religion, the dependence
upon the form of society is immediately apparent. The ‘classes’, <i>i.e.</i> the property-owners as a whole, see in the institutions that they have set up, the
strongest support of the capitalistic system, which must be maintained at any cost.
The property-owners have the power to uphold their unique <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>position by laws directed against those who would break down that power. And if the
laws are no longer sufficient, their place is taken by judicial interpretations in
the interests of the classes. This is only the logical consequence of the whole spirit
and aim of legislation. The greater become the rights founded upon property, the more
do those without property feel themselves to be deprived of their rights,—in the fullest
sense of the word—in jeopardy as to their existence, their full life; the more energetic
is the reaction against the laws, which are felt as despotism; and the more serious
is the attack upon those laws,—a characteristic phenomenon of all periods of transition
as to the form of society.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18907src" href="#xd31e18907">28</a>
</p>
<p>The question which presents itself now is this: how far are these factors connected
with existing economic conditions? But before entering upon this the author calls
attention to <i>the environment in which the children of the proletariat</i> live, and especially of the lower proletariat, an environment in which misery and
vice contend for the preëminence. There it is nearly out of the question to learn
ethical conceptions. Whence it comes also that in our days criminality among the young
has greatly increased. However, alcoholism must also be named as one of the most important
causes of psychical perturbations.
</p>
<p>It is not only the <span class="corr" id="xd31e18916" title="Source: non-possessers">non-possessors</span>, but also the possessors who are driven to commit crimes as a consequence of existing
economic conditions. “But not only for those without property, for the proletariat,
does capitalism furnish the psychically prerequisite conditions for crime … but for
the property-holders themselves. Entirely aside from business practices and tricks
of the trade, which stand upon the hairline between right and wrong, apart from the
frauds, forgeries, etc. that are evoked by too tempting opportunity, there are more
general effects of the capitalistic system. The hurried chase for gain, the accelerating
of commerce by railroad, steamship, telegraph, and telephone, the multiplication of
commercial crises, which earlier came at intervals, but now are a permanent accompaniment
of the social life, bring about a nervousness running through all circles of society,
that is continually increasing, and is the forerunner of more serious psychoses. The
terrible increase of cases of insanity (in Prussia, to the 10,000 of the population,
in 1871, 5.94 cases; in 1875, 7.28; in 1880, 9.87), appears to be thus directly caused
by capitalistic society.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18919src" href="#xd31e18919">29</a>
</p>
<p>However, there act in man as counter-determinants, combating <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>the factors called criminogenous, the <i>ethical factors</i> (“<span lang="de">ethische Hemmungsvorstellungen</span>”), which are determined by education, character, the fear of punishment, etc. Those
who do not wish to investigate the deepest causes of criminality, are of the opinion
that the best way to combat crime is by increasing the penalties. The persons who
speak thus forget that the so-called ethical factors have no longer any effect when
the conditions have reached a certain degree of seriousness.
</p>
<p><i>Crimes against persons.</i> It is the industrial workers who form the greatest contingent of criminals against
persons. “The continually changing conditions of earning a living, the desire for
drink, the slight influence of the family, the being crowded together with persons
of defective education and little training … these all necessarily breed crimes of
violence; entirely aside from the habitual rowdyism of the bully [“<span lang="de">Zuhälter</span>”<span class="corr" id="xd31e18937" title="Source: ,]">],</span> which is to be regarded as the consequence of prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18940src" href="#xd31e18940">30</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the external conditions named above, <i>the person of the criminal</i> is also to be noticed. We may consider it as proved that in some cases of crime one
of the causes is a mental perturbation (for example, that caused by drunkenness).
These perturbations play a great part in sexual crimes (perverted instincts). What
characterizes most of these mental anomalies is that they blunt the social instincts.
But there is another cause of psychic degeneracy. “It is a universally valid psycho-physical
law that man, ‘the more he depends upon an agreeable stimulation for the satisfaction
of his senses, demands ever stronger stimuli, even to secure the same degree of pleasure.’
Pleasures, especially sensual pleasures, must always become more intense, more titillating,
in order to afford satisfaction, but the more their intensity increases, the more
do the nerves become irritated and exhausted, and the more quickly is the ground prepared
for mental diseases either in the individual himself or in his descendants.—It must
be emphasized, however, that such an increase in the stimulus is only possible to
the rich, and accordingly it is with reference to them chiefly that these sources
of mental disturbances are to be taken into consideration.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18948src" href="#xd31e18948">31</a>
</p>
<p>After having called attention to the great amount of recidivism among female delinquents,
to the great increase of crime in our own day, and to the great percentage of young
people among the criminals, the author closes with the following words: “Crime belongs
in a society founded upon capitalism just as necessarily as do prostitution, <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>the destruction of countless human lives through economic exploitation, etc.”

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">P. Hirsch.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After having shown in the first chapter of his work, “<span lang="de">Verbrechen und Prostitution</span>”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18966src" href="#xd31e18966">32</a> the relation between criminality and prostitution, and the increase of the two at
the same time, the author gives, in his second chapter, a short exposition of the
doctrine of criminal anthropology, and in the third chapter he takes up the doctrine
of the social environment.
</p>
<p>Here he treats first of the <i>encouragement of prostitution and crime by the marriage restrictions</i>. Marriages increase or decrease as economic conditions grow better or worse. So,
for example, in Prussia there were, from 1866 to 1870, 1605 marriages to 100,000 of
the population; this number rose to 1896 in the period of prosperity between the years
1870 and 1875, only to fall, in 1888, to 1624. In bad times the number of illegitimate
births makes a consequent increase. It is very comprehensible that natural children
furnish a greater number of criminals than legitimate children, since they have more
difficulty in enduring the combat of life than the others.
</p>
<p>Then he sets forth as a cause of crime the <i>influence of domestic relations</i>. When the parents belong already to the class of criminals, it is almost inevitable
that their children should fall into the hands of justice while still young. And the
present system of production brings it about that the education of the children of
the proletariat is almost nil, since it obliges the father, and very often the mother
also, to work away from home during a great part of the day and often of the night.
The situation is still more unfavorable for the children who have lost their parents
when they were still quite young. Starke says that about 57% of the legitimate children
among the juvenile prisoners in Plötzensee were orphans or had been abandoned by their
parents.
</p>
<p>The third part has to do with <i>the housing conditions of the proletariat</i>. “A lodging fit for a human being is the first requirement for the bodily and mental
welfare of the family; it is the prerequisite for a well-regulated family life, and
for the rearing of the children to be moral men and women. The improprieties resulting
from the exigencies of insufficient lodgings are innumerable, and this condition <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>is an inexhaustible source of crime, prostitution, and vice of every kind.” All the
data prove that the proletariat, who, of all classes, pay the highest rent, are the
most miserably housed. In Berlin, for example, the poorest classes have been shown
to spend on an average a quarter of their income for rent. In Hamburg the part of
the income that had to go for rent among the class whose income was from 600 to 1200
marks, in 1868 was 18.77%, in 1874 20.90%, in 1882 23.51%, and in 1892 24.71%, while
the percentage remained the same or decreased for all other classes. In order to make
up the resulting deficit, resort is often had to night-lodgings. “The disadvantages
of subletting are obvious. ‘Children of both sexes have to sleep with their parents,
and often with strangers, in the same room, often even in the same bed; the advantages
of domesticity are lost; the tavern offers more pleasant entertainment than being
crowded together with wife and children in one room that must be shared with strangers,
and in which the opportunity for quarreling and fighting, in consequence of the narrow
quarters, is constant. It is the bad housing conditions that are the cause of the
increasing alcoholism, of the break-up of the family life, and of the lack of education
for the youth.’ (Braun).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18983src" href="#xd31e18983">33</a>
</p>
<p>The chapter that concerns us next treats of <i>the subsidiary businesses engaged in by school children</i>. It goes without saying that in the cases where the wages of the father of the family
must be increased by the labor of the mother, the children also must be put to work
at an age at which they ought to have their leisure time for play. For though child-labor
in factories is a little limited by legislation, it is still commonly practiced in
household industry. Further most of the children of the proletariat must, in their
free hours, do all kinds of work harmful to their physique and their morals. “It is
plain to be seen how greatly the school-children are injured by engaging in additional
work. Entirely aside from the harm they suffer in the matter of health, and from the
fact that the tired children cannot give sufficient attention to the words of the
teacher and that for many of them their instruction is as good as lost, is the great
fact that their morals are in the highest degree endangered. Under the pressure of
necessity, these children learn to grasp every advantage, whether allowable or not,
and—not through their own fault, but through that of society—are precociously familiar
with vice.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18990src" href="#xd31e18990">34</a> “Any one who examines these conditions will not be surprised that according to the
statement of Superintendent Schönberger, out of 100 juvenile prisoners <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>in the Plötzensee prison near Berlin, 70 had been employed during school days as breakfast-carriers,
newsboys, messengers, bowling-alley-boys, etc., early in the morning, from half past
four on, and in some cases still earlier, until school time, and in the afternoon
either the whole time, or from four till half past seven or half past eight at night.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e18995src" href="#xd31e18995">35</a>
</p>
<p>Next, Hirsch examines <i>the influence of economic crises</i>. He quotes, among other things, the following from the researches of J. S(chmidt).
During the economic depression from 1875 to 1878 the number of punishments inflicted
by the “<span lang="de">Ordnungspolizei</span>” in the country of Baden rose from 16,218 to 22,264, and that of the penalties inflicted
by the “<span lang="de">Sittenpolizei</span>” (having surveillance of prostitution) from 1995 to 4485. There were increases, therefore,
of 40% and 125%. In the period of prosperity from 1882 to 1885 these figures fell
from 22,765 to 18,856 (16%), and from 4106 to 4007 (3%). During the critical years
from 1889 to 1892 the number of recidivists convicted of theft rose 18%, and the number
of other thieves convicted 6%. In the period from 1875 to 1878 (years of crisis) the
number of offenses against property rose 17.4%, and decreased 13% in the years 1882
to 1885 (a period of prosperity).
</p>
<p>In conclusion the author points out the fact that there are also criminals who are
predisposed to crime by their physical constitution (mental disorders), and treats
of “the repression of crime and prostitution.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19010src" href="#xd31e19010">36</a>

</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In a discourse more distinguished by hatred of Marxism than by a knowledge of that
doctrine, Professor Benedikt said at the Congress of Criminal Anthropology held in
Brussels: “The partisans of the ‘<span lang="it">Terza Scuola</span>’ are in reality only Marxists.” Among those considered as belonging to the Third
School, there is only one Marxist as far as I know. Professor Benedikt may have been
led into his error by the fact that Dr. Colajanni, one of the principal partisans
of the Third School, and also one of the few criminologists of this school who has
written upon the affinity between criminality and economic conditions, is in agreement
with the Marxists in this, that he finds the causes of crime, in the last analysis,
in economic conditions. This is why I speak of Dr. Colajanni, as representing the
Third School, and of the socialists in the same chapter. Although Colajanni calls
himself a republican in political matters, he is nevertheless a partisan of an eclectic
socialism. (See “<span lang="it">Il Socialismo</span>.”) It is for this reason also that it is well to name him in this chapter. Other
partisans of the Third School are also, as it appears, more or less of this opinion
(see p. 18 of “<span lang="de">Die dritte Schule</span>”, where Dr. Rosenfeld treats of Professor Carnevale). However, it is evident from
the manner in which Dr. Colajanni treats the question, that he is not a Marxist.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e17596src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">CONCLUSIONS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having come to the end of my exposition, I have still to sum up the different chapters.
As we have seen, a very small proportion of the authors who have taken up the subject,
deny the existence of the relation between criminality and economic conditions, and
in my opinion they have not proved the correctness of their position.
</p>
<p>The great majority of authors are of the opinion that economic conditions occupy a
more or less important position, but that other factors besides these are also at
work. I have tried to show that as far as these factors are of a cosmic or religious
nature, this thesis cannot be correct; that as far as they are of an anthropological
nature, they play a rôle only with regard to a part of criminality.
</p>
<p>Finally, we have seen that a small number of authors are of the opinion that the influence
of economic factors is sovereign. I have been able to find no inaccuracies in the
foundations of their theses.
</p>
<p>Nearly all the authors—later I shall speak of the exceptions—have this in common,
that they give a very limited meaning to the words “economic factors”, under which
they include only poverty and wealth, and that they do not inquire whether these phenomena
do not themselves need explanation, and whether economic conditions have not a great
influence upon the whole social organization. They consider them as being phenomena
of the same value as the other sides of the social life. In other words, most authors
have omitted to explain the present mode of production and its consequences.
</p>
<p>However, economic conditions, in my opinion, occupy an entirely different place; they
are the foundation upon which the social structure rests. To make my thought clear
I will once more call attention to the classic formula of this doctrine, originated
by Marx and Engels, taken from the preface to the work, “<span lang="de">Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</span>”, which I have already quoted in treating of the theories of Professor Ferri.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>“In the social production of their life men enter into fixed, necessary relationships
in production, independent of their will, relationships which correspond to a definite
stage in the development of their material powers of production. The sum total of
these relationships forms the economic structure of society, the real basis upon which
the juristic and political superstructure is erected, and to which definite forms
of social consciousness correspond. The form of production of the material life conditions
the social, political, and intellectual life-process in general. It is not the consciousness
of mankind that determines their being, but their social being that determines their
consciousness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19128src" href="#xd31e19128">1</a>
</p>
<p>In the second part of this work I will try to sketch a treatment of the question according
to this theory. As regards economic conditions I shall limit myself, for different
reasons, to the present system, <i>i.e.</i> modern capitalism.
</p>
<p>These reasons are the following:
</p>
<p>First. A really scientific examination of the causes of criminality is only possible
since the existence of criminal statistics, i.e. since the beginning of the 19th century.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19138src" href="#xd31e19138">2</a>
</p>
<p>Second. Criminality has increased greatly under capitalism, and is of the greatest
importance to the whole social life.
</p>
<p>Third. An examination of historic criminality is very interesting; that of our own
day is still more so. However, social science is not simply a means of solving interesting
problems, but also, and chiefly, a means of pointing out to society the way to protect
itself from scourges like criminality, or if possible, to get rid of them entirely.
Here the saying of Marx applies: “The philosophers have only interpreted the world
differently; the important thing is to alter it.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Above I have already remarked that some authors have an opinion that differs from
that of the majority, and are in agreement with the theory cited. Among these must
be cited Engels, one of the two founders of this theory, and most of the authors of
whom I spoke in the last chapter. However, Engels has only made, in passing, some
observations upon the influence of capitalism on crime among the <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>workers in factories; Hirsch, in his interesting brochure, has pointed out only certain
sides of the economic life; and although the studies concerning this question published
by Lafargue and by Lux are more complete than those of the first two authors, there
are nevertheless important points which these last have not examined, or to the bottom
of which they have not gone, as it seems to me. And it is quite comprehensible that
it should be so; for the work of Lafargue is only a magazine article, and that of
Dr. Lux is one of the subdivisions of a social-political manual, in which he treats
of crime among other social phenomena. The works of the other authors noticed in Chapter
VII, do not make the study of the question in the manner noted, useless.
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion, then, that while the works quoted have made considerable progress,
there is still much to be done. It therefore appears to me that it will not be without
profit to take up the subject.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The theory of Marx and Engels results in our having a method of investigation already
marked out. While most authors who have published studies upon the question, have
thought it unnecessary to give an exposition of the economic system in which we live,
or perhaps have given a little attention to it along with other social conditions,
I shall begin by setting forth the present economic system as that upon which the
other parts of the social life rest. These I shall treat in their turn, in so far
as they are connected with criminality. It is obvious that this will be only a sketch,
for if one wished all the details, it would be enough to refer to the special literature
upon the subject. Then I shall investigate the question of how far criminality, under
its different forms, is the consequence of the conditions we have found.
</p>
<p class="small">[<span class="sc">Note to the American Edition</span>: According to some criticisms of my book it should have been my task not only to
give a sketch of the economic theory of Marx, but also to prove it “<span lang="la">in extenso</span>” and to refute the criticisms of it, since it is not universally accepted.
</p>
<p class="small">It is true that this theory has not been generally accepted—a thing that would be
impossible from the social consequences of such acceptation—but I claim that of all
the economic theories, that of Marx is the only one that daily wins more adherents,
and more and more interpenetrates all social science—even in the case of authors who
are the bitterest opponents of this theory.
</p>
<p class="small">To require that a book like mine should once more set forth and defend the theory
of Marx “<span lang="la">in extenso</span>”, is as impossible as to require that a modern biologist, who proceeds upon the basis
of the Darwinian theory, should prove over again that his basis is sound. That there
may be more or less error in detail in the theory of Marx, as in that of Darwin, is
possible, but in general they have resisted, like a wall of bronze, all attacks in
the most pitiless of contests, that of opinions.
</p>
<p class="small">Let the adversaries of Marx’s theory judge without prejudice whether that theory does
not constitute a great step in advance in criminology!]

<p class="first">In order to provide for his needs man has always been obliged to work, and this work
has always depended upon the physical environment and especially upon the means of
production. It is not our province to enquire how or why the means of production were
developed. It is enough to show that because of their development the products which
man had at his disposal were multiplied. Now when these products become too abundant
for one group of producers, a surplus results, which may be exchanged for products
of a different sort of which the first group of producers are deprived by reason of
their circumstances. These products, which are not destined for personal use but for
exchange are called commodities. Consequently it is its social qualities and not its
natural qualities that make a commodity of any given product. That an exchange may
be made, then, two conditions must be satisfied:
</p>
<p>First, There must have been a division of labor; for there would be no point in the
exchange of identical products. The objects to be exchanged are those which have no
immediate usefulness for the person who possesses them, while they are useful to those
who do not possess them.
</p>
<p>Second, The persons who are exchanging must have full power to <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>dispose of their products—in other words, they must be the possessors of the product
which they wish to exchange.
</p>
<p>In the beginning the relative quantities of the products exchanged for each other
must have varied greatly. But in course of time the exchange of commodities took place
in a ratio fixed for any one place and time; ten hatchets, for example, being equivalent
to five bows, etc. These commodities must have a common quality which makes a comparison
possible; and it is this common quality which we call their value. The first problem
to be solved, then, is this: “What constitutes the value of commodities?”
</p>
<p>To become a commodity anything must provide for some need of man; it must have the
value of usefulness. Without this value a product can never be a commodity. However,
it is impossible that the quality which different commodities have in common, and
on the basis of which they are compared, should be their usefulness, that is to say,
their natural qualities. For it is just because of their difference in usefulness
[to their possessors] that goods are exchanged.
</p>
<p>“As regards their use-value goods are primarily of different quality; as regards their
exchange-value they can only be of different quantity, without including a particle
of use-value.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19225src" href="#xd31e19225">2</a>
</p>
<p>Since usefulness does not count in exchange there is only one quality of the commodity
that remains, that of being the product of labor. And as we have withdrawn the consideration
of usefulness in estimating exchange-value, we must do the same for different kinds
of work, so that the only quality which remains to a commodity is that of being the
product of the labor of man in general. Any commodity, then, derives its value only
from the circumstance that it represents a certain amount of labor of man in general.
</p>
<p>The value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labor it represents, measured
by the time required. Naturally by “work” is to be understood here not individual
work, but social work; or as Marx says: “It is … the quantity of work socially necessary,
or the time socially necessary for the production of a commodity, which determines
its value.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19241src" href="#xd31e19241">3</a>
</p>
<p>In measure as the division of labor is developed, production for personal use diminishes,
and the production of commodities increases, until it finally becomes the universal
form of production, and one commodity (money) is developed as a universal equivalent.
As a <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>consequence of the development of the production of merchandise, the purchase and
sale of goods becomes a special profession. The merchant buys for a different reason
from that which influences his customers. While the latter buy for consumption, the
former buys to sell again and make a profit out of the transaction. The commodity
which serves for this purpose is called capital.
</p>
<p>Consequently capital comes into existence at the moment when the production of commodities
has attained a certain degree of development. Private property, the basis of the production
of commodities, begins from that point to show its capitalistic character, at first
in an imperceptible manner, which nevertheless becomes more and more developed. The
income of the artisan depends primarily upon his personal qualities; that of the capitalist—as
such—depends in the first place upon the amount of his capital. The working power
and capacity of an individual are limited, so that the quantity that he can produce
is also limited; while money can be heaped up without limit. The larger the sum of
money anyone uses as capital, the more the money can produce. But the reverse of the
medal is not so pretty. Side by side with the possibility of accumulating a fortune
there is that of becoming poor. This fact was not prominent at the entrance of capitalism
into the field, when poverty was not yet a general phenomenon, but it increased more
and more, so that at present we live in a society in which the greater part of the
population is poor.
</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages the trades were developed in Europe; the division of labor increased;
tools were perfected; and commerce was developed, chiefly as a consequence of the
improvement of the means of communication. The maritime route to India was discovered
as well as the American continent. Enormous sums of money, acquired by means of commerce
and pillage, flowed into Europe. With the discovery of these countries the outlets
for trade correspondingly increased. The trades, however, not being in a position
to furnish the great quantity of commodities required, the merchants determined themselves
to undertake the wholesale production of articles intended exclusively for sale.
</p>
<p>There was no lack of money to procure the raw materials and the tools, to establish
workshops and to hire workmen. The only difficulty to be overcome was that of procuring
these last. The workman who has in his own possession the means of production will
not sell his labor. To attain their end the capitalists had to seek for persons who,
having no means of production, were obliged to sell their productive energy or die
of hunger.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>For certain reasons it was possible for the needs of the capitalists to be satisfied.
On account of the development of the market in the cities the demand for food, and
for raw materials of every kind, such as wood, wool, etc., increased, and agricultural
production for the purpose of sale increased, so that the peasants began to have money.
This latter fact complicated the relation between them and the feudal lords. So long
as the rent was paid in kind the lord demanded only as much as he could consume; but
from the day that the rent began to be paid in money the landowner began to press
the peasant more and more, since money can always be used, and no one ever has enough.
From this fact arose so severe an exploitation that many peasants left the country
to take refuge in the towns.
</p>
<p>The second reason why a large number of workmen were obtainable was that the lords
themselves began to produce commodities for city markets, especially wool and wood.
This took fewer laborers than agriculture, but required more land, so that many peasants
were driven from their farms and, like the others, went to swell the population of
the cities.
</p>
<p>Thus there was no further obstacle to wholesale production, and from then on raw materials
were purchased, workshops established, and the labor of the proletariat procured.
Human labor thus has become a commodity, corresponding exactly to definition: first,
it has no use-value for the possessor if he has not the means of production, and,
on the other hand, has such a value for the person possessing these means; second,
the possessor of labor has the free disposition of it.
</p>
<p>The contract is made; the proletariat on the one side furnishes the commodity—labor—and
the capitalist on the other gives the equivalent of it. Now how much must be given
for this commodity? In other words what is the value of the labor delivered? The value
of a commodity is determined by the labor-time socially necessary for its production,
in this case necessary for the proletarian and his family to live; for the workman
being mortal, and capital having need of new forces, the wage must be sufficient to
raise a new generation of workers. The standard of the workman’s needs is subject
to variation according to time and place (the causes of which variation we need not
examine here), but it is fixed for a certain country, time, and category of workers.
</p>
<p>Let us suppose now that the process of production has a normal course, that is to
say, that it comes out as the capitalist wishes. He has begun with a sum, A, and ends
by possessing A + a. We must <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>now explain this surplus <i>a</i>, which, in the terminology of capitalistic production, is called <i>surplus-value</i>. The surplus obtained from the labor of slaves is easily explained. The owner leaves
the slaves a part of the product of their own labor to live on. The rest is his. His
surplus springs from the labor of others. The relation of the serf and his lord is,
if possible, even clearer. The serf works part of the week for himself and on the
remaining days for his master. The explanation of the surplus produced by capital
employed at usury or in primitive commerce (the most ancient forms under which capital
was employed) no longer offer any great difficulties. The usurer appropriated to himself
the possessions of the borrower little by little and so ruined him completely. The
primitive merchant made himself a surplus by selling dear something that he had bought
at a trivial price, a transaction which involved no increase in value. Now it is just
this increase in value that is to be explained upon the basis of the law that things
of equal value are exchanged, and not, as in the cases cited above, upon the exceptions
to the law.
</p>
<p>If we represent the transaction of one who buys, not to make a profit, but to exchange
something which has no use-value for him for something which has such a value (the
simple circulation of commodities), by the formula C—M—C, in which C stands for commodities
and M for money, we can represent the transaction of the capitalist by M—C—(M + m).
In this formula <i>m</i> stands for the surplus-value accruing to the capitalist at the end of a successful
operation. The latter formula is composed of the factors M—C<span class="corr" id="xd31e19273" title="Source: ;">,</span> the purchase of the commodity, and C—(M + m), the sale. According to the law of the
circulation of commodities the value of M ought to be equal to C, but C in turn must
be equal to M + m, a thing which is possible only if C is a commodity which, while
it is being consumed, produces a value greater than what it has. However, there is
no value without labor; consequently the formula cited can harmonize with reality
only if labor is itself a commodity. And, as we have seen above, it is such from the
moment that the economic development has reached a certain point.
</p>
<p>What is now the course of the production of the surplus-value? The capitalist has
fitted up a factory, has procured tools and raw material, has hired labor, and the
process of production commences. Suppose that the necessaries of life for the workman
and his family may be produced by six hours of work socially necessary; by making
him work, then, six hours the capitalist will have a product equal to that of the
raw material used, increased by that which is given it by <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>the tools and by the labor which the workman has put upon it. This value, however,
has been entirely paid out by the capitalist; he has no surplus left; the transaction
has failed. But ordinarily the process succeeds in procuring profits for the capitalist,
since in the contract between him and the laborer it is not stipulated that the latter
shall work only the number of hours necessary to produce enough for his own needs.
On the contrary the workman is compelled to labor as long as his strength will permit.
The value produced by the workman after the time necessary for the production of the
equivalent of his needs falls to the capitalist, and this it is which constitutes
the surplus-value, the value derived from work not paid for.
</p>
<p>The aim of the capitalist is to procure for himself as large a surplus-value as possible.
He can attain his end at once by forcing the laborer to work as long a time as it
is possible for him to work. From this springs the irreconcilable conflict between
the interests of the proletariat and those of capital, the combat over the length
of the working-day. The day has its natural limits (it is necessary that certain hours
be left to the workman for food and rest), its legal limits (decreed too late by the
state, driven on one side by the workers themselves, and on the other by the plain
certainty that without this protection the working class would become enfeebled),
and finally its limits fixed by the pressure of the labor unions.
</p>
<p>However, there is still one other way in which the surplus-value is increased, as
I shall explain by what follows. Let us suppose the length of the working day to be
twelve hours, and the time necessary for the production of the equivalent of the workman’s
needs to be six hours. We can then represent the day as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p252width"><img src="images/p252.png" alt="Line divided in 12 parts, with A at the start, C in the middle, and B at the end." width="230" height="18"></div><p>
</p>
<p>CB is consequently the time in which the surplus-value is produced. The aim of the
capitalist, then, is to protract the period CB as much as possible, and this he can
accomplish in two ways: first, that of which we have just spoken, the prolongation
of AB; second, the shortening of AC in order that CB may be as long as possible, or
in other words, the shortening of the time necessary for the production of the necessaries
of life for the workman and his family. When the productivity of labor rises, the
value of the commodities falls; and when the value of the commodities which the workman
needs for his <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>support falls, the value of labor falls also. However, the increase of the productivity
of labor is only possible through the improvement of the means of production and the
methods of working, so that capitalism modifies its manner of production unceasingly.
In general the capitalist does not take account of the fact that the more cheaply
commodities are produced for sale, the more the value of labor falls, and, other things
being equal, the more the surplus-value increases. The capitalist strives constantly
to make improvements in his methods of production in order to surpass his competitors.
Supposing that, by the employment of a new method of working, he succeeds in producing
in half an hour an article up to that time generally made in an hour, he will then
obtain an extra profit as long as his competitors do not employ this method. But as
soon as the latter have improved their production in the same way, the time socially
necessary falls from an hour to half an hour, and the extra profit of the man who
first introduced the method ceases. The result that remains is this: the value of
labor has decreased, and the relative surplus-value has consequently increased, in
so far as the commodities whose value has declined are destined to provide for the
needs of the workmen.
</p>
<p>Before entering upon the consideration of some of the methods for shortening the necessary
hours of labor, attention must be fixed upon the fact that, aside from this method,
the capitalist tries above all to lower the price of labor below its value, while
the workers, for their part, oppose this tendency and try to obtain the contrary;
whence there results a new cause for an inexorable struggle between labor and capital,
side by side with that over the length of the working-day.
</p>
<p>Let us now examine the methods of abridging the labor-time necessary, beginning with
coöperation. As we have seen above the capitalistic method of production begins when
the capitalist has in his service a sufficiently large number of workmen. In the days
of the guilds the master had also paid workers, but the surplus-value which he procured
from them was not great, since their number was small, a fact which obliged him to
work with them, since without this his income would have been too small. The true
capitalist is he who is permitted by the amount of the surplus-value which he receives
to live according to his rank, without working with his laborers, reserving to himself
only the direction of affairs.
</p>
<p>The difference, therefore, between capitalistic production and that at the time of
the guilds is in the first place only quantitative, but there come in qualitative
differences as well. In the first place the <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>differences in the individual capacities of the workmen disappear; the ability of
one neutralizes the smaller ability of the other, so that the capitalist can count
upon an average amount of labor. Next there is economy in the new arrangement; because
a structure to hold twenty-five workmen working together costs less than twenty-five
structures with one workman in each. Finally, and most important of all, by having
a number of men working together, each doing his own share toward the common end,
we bring about a systematic working together, that is to say, coöperation, which brings
into being a new collective force greater than the sum of the individual forces. Not
only does coöperation permit the accomplishment of work requiring a greater expenditure
of energy, but it also raises the productivity of labor. The direction necessary for
this joint labor falls to the capitalist as such. Submission of the workman to the
capitalist is, then, an indispensable condition of the capitalistic method of production.
</p>
<p>We come now to another method for increasing the relative amount of the surplus-value,
the manufactory proper, a more developed form of coöperation, which became general
between the middle of the sixteenth century and the end of the eighteenth. This comes
from two causes. On the one side it is due to the combination of different trades,
up to that point independent of each other. The manufacture of a carriage, for example,
requires the work of a wheelwright, a harness-maker, a painter, etc., who all exercise
their trades independently of each other. The capitalist unites them all in one trade,
that of carriage-maker, in which the occupation of each becomes more limited, more
specialized. The painter, for example, becomes especially a painter of carriages.
On the other side the manufactory is due to the bringing together of workmen of the
same trade into a single workshop, and to the division of labor made possible in this
way. Thus, for instance, in the manufacture of pins, each pin is no longer made by
a single workman but by several, each of whom does only a special part of the work.
</p>
<p>It is clear that through the introduction of manufactory methods the productivity
of labor has been enormously increased, so that the time necessary for the production
of the necessaries of life for the workmen has become shorter, and the surplus-value
correspondingly augmented. The part taken by the workman in the process of production
is quite different from what it was in the time of the guilds. The different operations
that he performed in making the complete product are now replaced by the monotonous
and repeated production <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>of a single one of the parts. From this point dates the division of workmen into skilled
and unskilled laborers. The latter are those whose work is such as to require little
or no apprenticeship, and they are the cause of a new lowering of the price of labor.
</p>
<p>We have still to take up the question of the introduction of machinery and of manufacturing
on a large scale. Although at the period of the early manufactories the workman was
obliged to perform a monotonous task, which in so far may be called “mechanical”,
yet this task was performed, though with the aid of tools, by his own hands. But in
the eighteenth century the machine was invented, that is to say, a mechanism which
took the place both of the workman and of his tools. Machines were introduced because
they saved hand-work, and consequently lowered the price of the product and relatively
increased the surplus-value.
</p>
<p>Each developed mechanism is composed of three parts: the motor, the transmission,
and the operating part. It is to the development of this last that the economic revolution
of the eighteenth century is due. However, there was needed a motive power greater
and more regular than those then available. The steam-engine, invented by James Watt,
provided for this need and, in its turn, led to new developments of operating machinery.
The steam-engine was capable of running many operating machines at the same time,
and thus the modern factory was established. In branches in which the product requires
a series of different manipulations, a system of machines has been contrived of which
one furnishes the material to the next without the intervention of hands, so that
a system of automatic mechanism has been produced.
</p>
<p>The revolution caused by the introduction of machines in one branch of industry necessitated
its introduction into another, etc. The means of communication and of transportation
were extended. The steamboat, the railroad, and the telegraph were invented. Because
of important inventions in the manufacture of machines it finally became possible
to produce the necessary quantity of machines of all kinds.
</p>
<p>What are the most important consequences of the new system of production? In the first
place stands the introduction of the labor of women and children, since tending machines
generally does not require great muscular strength. The advantages which accrue to
the capitalist from the employment of women and children are obvious. Since the price
of the workman’s labor is determined by the time necessary for the production of the
necessities of life not only for <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>himself, but also for his family, as soon as the whole family are compelled to sell
their labor, the price of that labor will simply equal that of the labor of the workman
alone. Ordinarily the income of the family will rise a little under these circumstances,
but, because of the absence of the wife from the household, expenses will increase
also. The increase of the surplus-value, obtained by the labor of women and children,
is therefore important. Besides, the women and children have less power to resist
the capitalist than men have, while the men, in their turn, are weakened by the competition
of women and children.
</p>
<p>In the second place the introduction of machines produces in the mind of the capitalist
a desire to prolong the working day as much as possible, for the following reasons
among others. The greater the number of hours each day in which the machine is in
operation, the more quickly it will return its cost through the product, and, other
things being equal, the shorter will be the time required for the capitalist to gain
the same amount of surplus-value. Suppose A works his machines for 8 hours a day,
and B works as many machines for 16 hours; B’s machines will return their cost through
the product in half the time needed by A’s. Consequently B will gain double the surplus-value
in the same time, so that A also will be driven to work his machines for 16 hours.
And since a machine deteriorates even when it is not in use, there is, when the machines
are stopped, a loss of value which the capitalist cannot retrieve. Hence the tendency
to prolong the working-day. In the third place every capitalist runs the danger of
seeing his competitors introduce new machines which save still more work and so diminish
the value of his own. The more quickly a machine returns its cost, the less the danger
just mentioned becomes.
</p>
<p>Finally, I have still to notice the following cause for the prolongation of the working-day.
The object of the employment of machines is the increase of the surplus-value through
their use. This increase, however, is possible only through the diminution in the
number of workmen employed by the capitalist. But since the surplus-value is created
only by the workmen, any diminution in their number is to the disadvantage of the
capitalist. In order to overcome this he attempts to prolong the day.
</p>
<p>The more machinery is developed, the more the attention which the workman must give
to his work increases; in other words, the more intense the labor becomes. The tendency
of the capitalist to increase the intensity of labor reaches its apogee as soon as
the working time is limited, for different reasons. In order that the surplus-value
may <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>be equal to what it was formerly, the workman, for example, must produce as much in
eleven hours as he formerly produced in thirteen hours. The means by which the intensity
of labor is increased (not to enter into unnecessary details) are; first, the manner
of fixing wages—piece-work, and second, the practice of making the workmen tend more
machines than formerly, and of driving the machines faster, so as to force the workmen
to a greater intensity of labor.
</p>
<p>The contest between the large manufacturing establishments and the small factories
and workshops has led gradually but infallibly to the destruction of the latter. They
are forced to maintain the competitive struggle by incredibly long hours of labor,
by an unlimited exploitation of the labor of women and children, etc. In this way
it is often possible to resist competition for some time, but finally the large manufactory
triumphs all along the line.
</p>
<p>Agriculture also, though to a less degree than manufacturing, has been revolutionized
by the introduction of machines. Rural workers who have become superfluous have betaken
themselves to the cities, and there go to swell the population already enormously
increased by industrialism.
</p>
<p>The exposition which I have just given of the origin of the surplus-value is sufficient
for this work. It is not necessary for our subject to stop to consider the fact that
a part of the surplus-value is destined to become capital, while the other part is
consumed by those who have appropriated the whole. As has been shown above, the employment
of machines, etc., has increased in every branch of industry, and this has brought
it about that the capital necessary to any manufacturing establishment increases continually
under the pressure of competition. Hence it follows that capitalism itself forces
the capitalist to invest as new capital part of the surplus-value acquired by him.
But aside from this, it is capitalism also that produces the capitalist’s penchant
for always investing more capital, which, in its turn, produces a greater surplus-value
than the original capital, etc. And since the accumulation of capital has no limits,
the greediness of the capitalist has none, and he is driven to increase his capital
incessantly, even when his income is so great that it permits him to satisfy every
possible need.
</p>
<p>However, the group of capitalists of which we have been speaking is not the only one
that gains surplus-value. Industrial capital is obliged to share the total surplus-value
with commercial capital, the capital consisting of money, and that consisting of real
estate. In the first place, a part of the surplus-value is claimed by commercial <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>capital. For the economic system in force would not be able to operate without commerce.
The development of capitalism has led to an extensive division of labor in the class
of capitalists (banks, insurance companies, etc.), and the capital invested in these
enterprises must equally have its share of the total surplus-value. Capital in the
form of money plays an increasingly important part in modern capitalism, and so must
have its share of the surplus-value.
</p>
<p>The owners of the soil also appropriate a considerable part. The land is the most
indispensable means of production, and is incapable of being increased at will. As
capitalism increases, the demand for territory becomes greater and greater. This causes
the ground rents in general to rise, which means that the share of the total surplus-value
which the land-owners appropriate becomes greater and greater. It is especially in
the cities, which are highly developed under capitalism, and in which, consequently,
the demand for land is great and the supply relatively small, that ground rents have
risen to an unheard of degree, and this to the prejudice of the health and happiness
of the less privileged classes.
</p>
<p>Up to this point we have been necessarily supposing that the capitalist succeeds in
making a profit. But, as we know, it often happens that he does not attain his end,
that his capital produces no added value, that he even loses it entirely or in part.
This case being important for the subject in hand we must stop to consider it for
a moment. As has been shown above, the capitalist begins by purchasing labor and the
means of production in order to set in motion the process of production. For him the
difficulty then consists of selling the manufactured product at its value and of thus
realizing the added value which is a part of this. At times, aided by circumstances,
he succeeds in selling the product above its value, and so makes an extra profit.
On the other hand, he runs the risk of having to sell the product below its value,
or of not being able to sell it at all.
</p>
<p>The causes of the poor success of the process are of different kinds. In the first
place, the capitalist may not have the ability necessary for the direction of the
process of production. For example, the product made under his management may be inferior
to that of his competitor, though the cost of production is the same; the means of
production may be purchased at too high a price; he may not have been in touch with
the tastes of consumers, etc.; reasons all of which render his product unsalable,
or salable at a loss.
</p>
<p>In the second place, circumstances independent of his own act may present themselves
which have the same result. Let us look at some <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>of them. To begin with, the unforeseen cessation of payment on the part of one of
his important debtors may oblige him to sell his goods at a sacrifice in order to
satisfy his creditors. Again, he may lack the capital necessary to meet competition.
For the amount of capital necessary in every branch of industry or commerce becomes
greater and greater, and the man who cannot procure this capital is forced little
by little to give ground to his competitors and finally to give up business altogether.
</p>
<p>In the third place, it very often happens that, as a result of competition, there
is an oversupply of commodities, which from this very fact are unsalable, or must
be sold for less than their value. In the periods of prosperity this case is not general.
But it is the rule in crises. Because of their great importance to the relation between
criminality and economic conditions, it is necessary to pause here to examine the
cause and origin of these crises.
</p>
<p>Economic crises, that is to say periods in which the economic life is greatly disturbed,
are due to various circumstances; for example, to a war which puts obstacles in the
way of the regular continuance of international commerce. But aside from such causes
there are others which are natural to the present economic system itself, and which
bring on these crises periodically. It is these causes, which are the more important,
of which it is necessary to treat here.
</p>
<p>A crisis is the result of overproduction. This does not imply that in every case overproduction
will bring about a crisis. If one who is producing for his own consumption happens
to produce more than he can consume, the result will be that during a certain period
he will proceed to produce less, and the equilibrium will be reëstablished. But when
one manufactures not for himself but for the market the situation is entirely different.
Each manufacturer of commodities produces separately, that is to say without any understanding
with his fellow-manufacturers, articles of which he himself has no need, but which
he attempts to exchange for money in order to obtain what he does need. If he does
not succeed in selling his commodities he is left without money to buy the commodities
that are necessary to him. Overproduction can thus have very harmful results for those
who hold commodities.
</p>
<p>Now how does it happen that the capitalistic mode of production causes periodically
a production greater than the possible consumption? (It goes without saying that this
phrase is not to be taken to mean that the consumers are physically incapable of using
the product, but merely that there are not enough buyers.) As has been shown <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>above, capitalistic production is carried on for the sake of the added value, that
is to say, the value of the unpaid labor. In other words, the working class produces
more than it consumes. In feudal society the surplus was entirely consumed by the
class which appropriated it; at present, on the contrary, the owning class use part
of the surplus to form new capital. For this comes a continually increasing accumulation
of capital, and consequently a greater and greater quantity of products which in the
end find no buyer. For the extension of production increases the number of workmen
necessary, and consequently increases the demand also, but these workmen produce in
their turn more than they consume. The overproduction is not, then, neutralized by
a greater consumption. On the contrary it furnishes the material for an overproduction
still greater. Hence capitalism causes crises periodically as the result of an overproduction
caused by too small a consumption on the part of the working class.
</p>
<p>Since the mass of capital increases without cessation it is indispensable to find
new investments, and to broaden the market. From this it results, among other things,
that the capitalist class is forced to take up the policy of political expansion and
to conquer countries where capitalism has not yet become rooted. If it succeeds in
finding a new outlet, then, production increases enormously, existing factories are
enlarged, new ones are established, etc., and the new market is inundated with goods.
But in the end this market ceases to be able to absorb the continually increasing
mass of products, so much the more since the production of the country itself also
increases as capitalism gains foothold there. The commodities remain, then, unsold,
and a crisis is begun. Production must be stopped or decreased; the stock of commodities
being thus made smaller the equilibrium begins little by little to reëstablish itself;
after which the movement is repeated. But since the capitalistic method of production
little by little spreads itself over the whole earth, it becomes increasingly difficult
to find countries where capitalism has not been implanted. Hence overproduction tends
to become chronic.
</p>
<p>Besides the cause already set forth there is still another circumstance which can
produce a crisis or aggravate one already existing; I refer to the lack of order in
the present mode of production. Suppose that the demand for iron is great at any given
moment. The production will then increase so quickly, and in such a degree (each manufacturer
ignoring what his competitors are doing), that the supply will far exceed the demand.
As a result manufacturing will be checked. As soon as overproduction occurs in as
important a branch of industry <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>as the manufacture of iron, there will follow also a stoppage of production in other
branches, and a general crisis will ensue.
</p>
<p>The consequences of a crisis for the capitalist class are well known. Many are forced
to stop producing, are no longer able to pay their creditors, and draw many of their
debtors in their train. Because of the complexity of the present system of production
the consequences of a crisis are very far reaching. It is naturally the small capitalists
who are stricken first, whence it follows that during crises there is a great concentration
of capital.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Just as in the first part of this discussion I proceeded on the assumption that the
capitalist always attains his end, <i>i.e.</i> gains the surplus-value, just so I have also been speaking as if the workman always
sold his labor. Let us look now at the case of the man who does not succeed in selling
it. In order that a contract be entered into between capitalist and workman it is
necessary that labor be desired and offered. If the workman for his part cannot deliver
the labor contracted for, or not enough of it, whether from sickness or from weakness,
it is perhaps but a question of exchange, and the workman is abandoned to his fate.
Capitalism rests upon this fact that there is a class of men, much more numerous than
any other, who are deprived of everything and consequently are forced to sell their
labor; otherwise no workman would care to close a contract.
</p>
<p>Let us look at the other side of the question, when the supply of labor exceeds the
demand. Those who do not succeed in selling their labor are then equally abandoned
to their own resources. From what causes in the capitalistic method of production
does it happen that the supply of labor is in excess of the demand? Are these causes
to be found in too great an increase in the population, or in the method of production
itself?
</p>
<p>It has been shown above that the composition of capital changes incessantly. Machinery
becomes more and more developed and a great part of capital is composed of machines.
The introduction of machines has taken place because they economize labor. Thus a
certain number of workmen find themselves without occupation. It is true that there
is a mitigating circumstance, namely that there is an increased demand for labor in
other branches (manufacture of machines), but this demand can never be as great as
the amount of labor rendered superfluous by machinery, for otherwise machines would
never have been introduced. However short the apprenticeship required by modern industry,
it is nevertheless impossible for a <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>workman to change from one branch to another at short notice. Thus the consequences
for workmen thrown out of employment continue to be serious notwithstanding the increased
demand in another branch. The only case in which the introduction of machines will
occasion no unemployment will be when the demand for commodities increases extraordinarily,
as, for example, when a new market is opened up.
</p>
<p>However there are still other causes of forced unemployment. Such are the introduction
of the labor of women and children, the migration of rural workers to the cities,
immigration from backward countries, and the supplanting of small businesses, by which
members of the lower middle class are forced down into the proletariat.
</p>
<p>The causes of overpopulation are found, then, in the system of production itself,
and not in a too great increase of the population; a conclusion to be drawn also from
the fact that as far as actual productivity of labor is concerned each produces more
than enough for his needs. There are, then, always a number of persons who desire
to work but cannot find employment. In periods of crisis the number of these increases
enormously. The so-called “reserve army of labor” is a condition indispensable to
capitalism. Without it sudden development in periods of prosperity would be impossible.
Without it also the power of organized labor would become so great that the surplus-value
would run serious danger. It is just because the supply of labor exceeds the demand
that the power of the capitalists over the workmen is so great, and also that it happens
so often that the interests of the workmen are thwarted.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We come now to the end of my exposition. For our subject it is unnecessary to continue
it further. I should like, however, to draw attention to two more points. The continually
increasing concentration of capital has as a consequence that the conduct of the business
under the direction of the capitalist himself more and more gives place to the stock
company, which combines the capital of numerous persons, and gives the direction to
a salaried employe. Following this, concentration drives the owners in one branch
of industry to combine for the purpose of eliminating competition, and thus of increasing
profits; in this way the “trusts” come into being. Competition, the fundamental principle
of capitalism, is changed into its opposite, monopoly.

<h3 class="main">SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us pass now to the social condition in which the different social classes live
in consequence of the place they occupy in the economic system.
</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.1.2.a">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">A.</span> <span class="sc">The Bourgeoisie.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a long and difficult struggle against feudalism the bourgeoisie, the class possessing
the means of production, came out victorious. It has grown and become more powerful,
and in almost all the countries where capitalism exists it is still the directing
class.
</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie is divided into three groups. The first comprises the capitalists
who direct their business themselves. As has been shown in the preceding pages the
power of this group is based upon its monopolizing the surplus-value. The idea which
predominates among the bourgeoisie in general, and particularly among the first group,
is to gain money, always more money. This thirst for gold is not quenched when the
man has arrived at a point where he can live a luxurious life and gratify all his
caprices. Thanks to capitalism it is possible to amass wealth without limit, so that
the capitalist is never satisfied, however enormous may be the sums which he has gained.
The consequence is that in general he is little developed in other directions, uses
all his time in attaining the end he wishes for, has a mind only superficially cultivated,
and if he is interested in art he regards it simply as a pastime which he procures
for money.
</p>
<p>Next to this group comes that of the persons whose sole occupation consists in appropriating
a part of the surplus-value to increase their capital and in spending the rest for
a luxurious life. It is unnecessary to set forth here the regrettable consequences
of idleness and too easy a life. Doubtless there are in this group some persons who
work and do not squander their income. But the fact remains that <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>the present economic system produces a class who are not forced to work and can dissipate
what others produce. The luxury displayed by the bourgeoisie has injurious consequences
for the whole population. Not only do many persons aid this class in spending a part
of the surplus-value, but further, as a consequence of the uninterrupted increase
of luxury among the bourgeoisie (the result of the continued increase in the surplus-value),
desire becomes so much the greater among the other classes as they have the less possibility
of satisfying it.
</p>
<p>The development of capitalism (the growth of stock companies) is the reason why the
above-mentioned group of capitalists increases in comparison with the first group.
The control of affairs is more and more abandoned to salaried employes. With these
we come to the third and last group; the so-called liberal professions, in which men
provide for their needs by intellectual labor. They are not capitalists in the strict
sense of the term, for they live by selling their labor; but as they are recruited
principally from the bourgeoisie, and in general have nearly the same standard of
living as the bourgeoisie, it will be best to treat them here. Under the capitalistic
system those who cultivate science or the arts are obliged to sell their products.
There was a time when their number being limited their products brought a high price.
However the development of capitalism has been the cause of a continually increasing
demand for these persons. The task of the state and municipality becoming constantly
greater requires an increasing number of functionaries; the larger application of
science to industry demands more engineers, chemists, etc.; the multiplication of
stock companies puts the direction of affairs more and more into the hands of salaried
employes; etc., etc.
</p>
<p>The extension of university education produced a greater supply, and this occasioned
a considerable fall in the price of the commodity. In the end the supply began to
exceed the demand; in this territory also there is an overproduction. Thence it happens
that the price of this commodity often falls below its value, and thus a sort of scientific
proletariat is formed. Just as the merchant on account of overproduction in his branch
can dispose of his goods only by taking advantage of every possible method, so men
of the liberal professions must at times have recourse to similar means if they wish
to attain a great success or even to support themselves.
</p>
<p>Although I speak of these persons under the head of “bourgeoisie” this is not an exact
classification. Not only does their material <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>condition sometimes differ from that of the bourgeoisie, but in other regards they
cannot be treated under the same head. Many of them are descendants of those who have
practiced the same profession; others have come from among the bourgeoisie proper,
and have chosen the profession in question from inclination and natural disposition.
These circumstances as well as the influence of the profession itself bring it about
that for the last group the gaining of money is not the principal end as with the
first, but that other motives also impel them.
</p>
<p>In the next place we must fix our attention upon a matter which concerns the entire
body of the bourgeoisie: the uncertainty of the future, for no one, not even the richest,
is sure of it. In the exposition of the economic system which we have been considering
the principal causes of this state of things have been indicated; it is therefore
useless to go over the details again. It is not only those who lack capital or the
ability to direct an enterprise, whose position is uncertain. A manufacturer can be
ruined by an invention which makes his product unsalable; an unforeseen fall in price
may have the same effect upon a merchant; etc., etc. This uncertainty reaches its
height during crises, and, as a consequence of the complexity of economic life at
present, the fall of one has disastrous consequences for those who have relations
with him. From this it happens that to the agitation and weakness which are the consequences
of competition, is added the fear of losing one’s position.
</p>
<p>The cause of this fear is obvious. The capitalist who is ruined, and the stock-holder
whose securities become valueless, see themselves thereby deprived of everything that
makes life worth living, power, luxury, importance, etc., while the possibility of
recovery without capital seems very small. This is especially true of the first two
groups of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless the position of the liberal professions is
not very stable, though it is somewhat more so than that of the other groups.
</p>
<p>Whence does the bourgeoisie recruit itself? In great part from the descendants of
the bourgeoisie, in a less degree from the other classes. If a “petit-bourgeois” or
a proletarian finds himself incorporated into the ranks of the bourgeoisie it is by
virtue of extraordinary circumstances. They may reach this station because they have
qualities which especially fit them to direct capitalistic enterprises; but in this
case circumstances must arise to bring their capacity to light and give them a chance
to develop it.
</p>
<p>Although a relatively small number succeed in passing from another class to that of
the bourgeoisie, this does not prevent nearly all from <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>having an ardent desire to enrich themselves and from seizing every opportunity which
may help them attain this end. (The only exception is found in those workers who understand
that the historic task of the working class is to found a society where there shall
be neither rich nor poor.) A man will often start a factory or a shop without having
either capital or ability, in the hope of raising himself in the social scale; and
unless the circumstances are extraordinarily favorable failure follows almost immediately.
This applies also quite as strongly to the capitalists who for one reason or another
have failed in business; they try to gain success in another branch at any cost, even
if capital and ability are lacking. But such a course can only retard their fall,
and they end infallibly by sinking permanently to the rank of the proletarian.
</p>
<p>What I have just been saying brings out strongly the character of the present process
of production. Production is not undertaken for the sake of consumption, but for profit,
so that the man who believes that he has a good chance to improve his condition goes
to work to produce, without asking himself whether there is need of his products,
or whether he can meet the required conditions.
</p>
<p>As to the relation of the bourgeoisie, as a class, to other classes, and especially
to the proletariat, a few words will suffice after the exposition I have given of
present economic conditions. “In every nation there are two nations.” These words
describe the relations in question. From their mode of life the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat remain strangers to one another.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19399src" href="#xd31e19399">4</a> The bourgeoisie, having arrived at a wrong idea of the present system, do not consider
the proletariat as the class which sustains society by its toil, but as a necessary
evil. According to the bourgeois every strike is a diminution of his rights, an encroachment
upon his property. In the political field the bourgeoisie, notwithstanding its intrinsic
divisions, acts as a unit against the proletarians; a fact which does not prevent
there being opposing interests within the class: in the first place the contest of
the different groups of capitalists (manufacturers against agrarians, etc.) and then
the opposing interests of the manufacturers within each group.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">B.</span> <span class="sc">The Petty Bourgeoisie.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In reality the line of demarcation between the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie
is not drawn with the precision desirable for a theoretical exposition. Just as there
are numerous gradations in the bourgeoisie, so are there in the petty bourgeoisie.
</p>
<p>It is the petty bourgeoisie which has among its different classes the most ancient
traditions. There was a time when it was strong and powerful. But the development
of capitalism has changed all that. Industrialism has arisen and undermined the petty
bourgeoisie. In the combat the small capitalist must eventually go down. He has not,
like his adversaries, scientific forces at his disposal, has no great credit, cannot,
in consequence of the insufficiency of his capital, make use of new inventions; in
short, his arms are inferior to those of his antagonists. All this does not make him
renounce the contest at once; on the contrary, it arouses him to bring all his forces
into play. In consequence of his position in the economic life he has no breadth of
view. He cannot comprehend that what earned bread for his ancestors during so many
years will some day fail. This is the reason that, as soon as large capital enters
into the competition, the small manufacturer overdrives himself, and not only himself
but his workmen also, and further, attempts to lower wages, lengthen the working day,
and introduce women and children to take the place of men. Competition forces the
merchant to take advantage of his customers in all sorts of ways, a fact which gives
commerce its character; for the art of commerce is to buy cheap and sell dear. Hence
there is opposition between the merchant and the manufacturer on the one hand, and
between merchant and customer on the other. This is why the merchant is led to depreciate
the article he buys, and to praise that which he is selling. This tendency naturally
becomes stronger as competition becomes fiercer. Advertising, a system of deceit,
is invented to draw purchasers at any cost; and the point is even reached where men
no longer give exact weight (“My competitors do not give it,” says the merchant to
himself), and sell goods of poorer quality than represented. This is why commerce
has a moral code of its own.
</p>
<p>However, notwithstanding their desperate resistance, the situation of the petty bourgeoisie
becomes worse and worse, and this has important social consequences, for example,
the increase of the labor of women outside of their own homes. Whole groups of the
petty bourgeoisie are so fallen into decadence that the plane of their existence <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>has become the same as that of the proletariat, or has even fallen below it. Finally
the contest with the large capitalist means not simply degradation to the petty bourgeois,
but absolute ruin. When a crisis comes the small capitalists are the first to feel
the shock. Their ruin may come in various ways; their business may be annihilated
altogether—in which case they are permanently reduced to the ranks of the proletariat—or
it may become dependent upon great capital under the name of home industry, <i>i.e.</i> wage labor masked under the appearance of independence. Only those who have been
able to save a part of their capital from the wreck can try fortune once more in another
branch of industry where great capital has not yet begun to compete, but they are
sure to be pursued and finally overtaken by their enemy.
</p>
<p>As in the case of the bourgeoisie, the relations which the different members of the
petty bourgeoisie have among themselves are determined by the economic system; fierce
competition, life in a little circle where ideas cannot be broadened, all this breeds
envy, hatred, and meanness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19422src" href="#xd31e19422">5</a>
</p>
<p>As to intellectual culture a great part of the petty bourgeoisie takes rank between
the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Generally the children of this class are better
taught than those of the proletariat. But since the field of their ideas is very restricted
and the struggle for existence requires all their time, their intellectual level remains
in general much below the average level of the bourgeoisie. Others still who are of
the lowest stratum of the petty bourgeoisie have the same development as the proletariat.
</p>
<p>The petty bourgeoisie is recruited from the descendants of the same class, then from
among the bourgeois who have failed in business, and finally from former proletarians.
These last are those who cannot sell their labor for some reason, and try to gain
a livelihood by making an insignificant capital of value in trading. Their plane of
living does not differ from that of the proletariat unless by being lower.
</p>
<p>As to the relation of the petty bourgeoisie to the other classes, it is naturally
hostile to the bourgeoisie, since it is that class which has deprived it, or is still
depriving it, of its influence. This hostility is, however, of a different kind from
that which the working class feels toward the bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie envies
the bourgeoisie; it desires also to become rich, and thereby powerful. <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>On the other hand it feels no community of interest with the working class, whose
fixed determination to be free from the wage system it holds in abhorrence. The political
position of the petty bourgeoisie, placed as it is between the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat, has necessarily become an equivocal one.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.1.2.c">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">C.</span> <span class="sc">The Proletariat.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The proletariat, that class of persons who do not possess the means of production
and who can exist only by the sale of their labor, dates from modern times. Between
the independent artisan and the modern proletarian comes the journeyman as a link
in the chain. The difference, however, between the journeyman and the proletarian
is great. The journeyman generally lodged with his master, worked with him, and was
considered as a member of the family. And since the means of production necessary
were still quite limited, the journeyman by saving his wages had a chance some day
to become master. With this hope he came to consider himself as having common interests
with his employer.
</p>
<p>The situation of the proletarian is entirely different. His work is entirely separate
from that of his employer; the lengthening of the working-day does not imply that
the capitalist works longer also. The workman lodges apart, and it makes little difference
to the employer how his employes are housed and fed. The means of production being
very dear, and the knowledge necessary to direct any business being lacking, the proletarian
can almost never become an employer.
</p>
<p>As has been shown it is the ruined members of the petty bourgeoisie who have formed
the first stock of the proletariat. But although this class is still reinforced in
the same way the greatest part of the proletariat is now composed of the descendants
of proletarians.
</p>
<p>We can easily comprehend the situation of the proletariat provided we do not lose
sight of the basis of the present economic system, that is, the fact that the object
of production is to gain for some the largest possible surplus-value at the expense
of the rest of the population. The child of the proletarian is set to work at an age
when the child of the bourgeois parents is still leading a care-free life, with nothing
to do but to develop his powers. When taken to the factory the young proletarian finds
himself in the midst of ignorant and coarse men caring nothing for him, and soon picks
up their bad habits. It is in this environment that the proletarian will pass <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>the greatest part of his life without hope of ever raising himself above it.
</p>
<p>The greater part of the trades practiced have an unfavorable effect, frequently even
very harmful to the health of the workmen (on account of great heat, too much dust,
injurious gases, etc.)<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> These prejudicial influences might be checked or prevented, but it costs money to
make a factory sanitary, with no immediate return, and hygienic suggestions are therefore
generally not followed. A number of trades constantly threaten the workers with death
or mutilation; but although safety devices can almost always remove the danger, for
the reason above stated they are still many times left untried.
</p>
<p>As regards the length of the working-day<span class="corr" id="xd31e19459" title="Source: ;">,</span> moderate work is a pleasure, excessive work mere torment. Except in so far as the
laws and the labor unions have intervened, the day has been prolonged until there
is left only the time absolutely necessary for food and sleep. Many workmen are not
even given the night for sleeping, for in many factories the night force succeeds
that on duty in the daytime. We may read in the holy Scriptures that a day has been
set aside for rest, but this does not prevent Sunday from being a day of work under
the capitalistic system, even though we are supposed to be living in a Christian society.
</p>
<p>In general the work in factories is very monotonous, and hence brutalizing; and further,
fatiguing from its great intensity. Moreover a vexatious discipline is sometimes maintained.
However harmful may be the results of factory labor upon the physical, intellectual,
and moral condition of the worker, they are less so than the results of sweat-shop
labor. For sweat-shop hours are still longer than those of the factory; and the work
is done in a place which is both kitchen and bedroom, so that not only is the workman
injured but his family as well.
</p>
<p>Let us now take up the question of wages. It is necessary that the wage should be
enough to procure what is strictly needful, and in fact wages generally do not rise
above this standard. Further the workman buys at a high price goods of low quality,
for he who cannot spend much is powerless in dealing with the producers. Since the
workman does not draw his wages till he has done the work, he must get credit for
the necessaries of life (often being obliged to add to his debts on account of sickness
or unemployment). His wages prevent his paying his debts, and force him, therefore
to continue to trade with his creditor, who cheats him at every turn. Again, in some
branches of industry he is obliged to buy what he wants from <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>the capitalist, or from the foreman (truck-system), or to live in a house which belongs
to the capitalist (cottage system)—and then gets poorer quality at a higher price
than elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Let us take up next the dwellings of the proletariat. Capitalism is the cause of a
great congestion of persons in a limited area. An enormous rise in the price of land
in the cities and consequently a similar rise in rents have been the result. No class
spends a larger part of its income in rent than the laboring class. The proletariat
is not only lodged expensively but badly. All those who pass through the laborers’
districts know the monotonous rows of houses, ill-built, uniform and simple. But the
internal arrangement of these buildings is much more miserable; the stairs and landings
are narrow, the rooms small, badly lighted and ventilated, and often must serve for
kitchen and bedroom combined. But notwithstanding the limited space, the number of
inmates often is further increased by taking lodgers, in an attempt to make both ends
meet. For all these reasons the house of the working-man is not a real home in which
he can be at ease.
</p>
<p>As if these consequences of capitalism were not serious enough, the labor of married
women is added. By this the life of the family, already damaged in so many ways, has
been destroyed. Furthermore the physical effect upon the woman, and even more upon
the child with which she is pregnant, is most prejudicial, without reckoning that
her moral condition suffers equally.
</p>
<p>Up to this point I have been speaking of the proletarian on the supposition that he
has been able to sell his labor-power. But, as we have seen already, when this sale
is not possible, he and his family are left to their fate. This then is what freedom
of labor means, a freedom that the slave never knows, freedom to die of hunger. No
one guarantees to the workman or his family the means of subsistence if, for any reason,
he is not able to sell his labor. The slave-owner had an interest in taking care of
a sick slave, for the slave represented value which he did not care to see diminished.
But if a workman is sick he is discharged and replaced by another. The sickness and
death of the laborer do not harm the capitalist at all.
</p>
<p>I have set forth above the numerous causes which prevent the workman from selling
his labor. Forced idleness has become chronic little by little, reaching its acute
stage in times of crisis. Then seasonal trades make the work of thousands dependent
upon the weather. Aside from general causes, which affect whole groups, there are
also individual causes. A workman displeases his employer, it may be because he is
one of the leaders of a union, or for some other reason; <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>he is discharged, and runs, especially in times of economic depression, the risk of
not being able to find employment elsewhere. If the worker falls ill or is injured
(this often happens as a consequence of an unhealthful or dangerous trade), or when
he reaches old age (and hard work ages men quickly), he is condemned. If the period
of idleness lasts long the workman loses his ability and the habit of working (for
working is above all a habit), and the time is not far distant when he will become
altogether incapable of working.
</p>
<p>The intellectual condition of the working class is easily understood. In his youth
the child learns but little. The circle of his ideas remains restricted, since his
parents have ordinarily neither the knowledge, the opportunity, nor the desire to
supplement the little that is learnt at school. At the age when the child begins to
think for himself, and his aptitudes begin to manifest themselves, he is put to work.
The little that the proletarian has learned in his childhood is quickly forgotten
under the pressure of the long, monotonous toil, which dulls his intelligence and
makes him thus less sensitive to higher impressions. Even if this were not the case,
the long duration of labor fatigues the workman too much, his domestic life does not
permit him to develop himself, and further he has no money for intellectual pleasures.
The pleasures of the workman belong to his kind of life. Consequently his amusements
are rough and coarse. Alcohol and sexual intercourse are often the only pleasures
he knows.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19477src" href="#xd31e19477">6</a>
</p>
<p>The life of the working-man is less retired than that of the bourgeois. He sees continually
the misery of his companions, which is also his own, he feels himself more at one
with them, but the demand for labor always remaining below the supply, competition
among the workers arouses antagonistic feeling among them. The possibility of some
day becoming rich being almost entirely cut out, the working-man is less avaricious
than the bourgeois, and less economical; he lives from day to day, and if he happens
to get a little more than usual at any time he spends it at once.
</p>
<p>The situation may be summed up as follows: under the capitalistic system the greater
part of the population, the part upon whose labor the entire social fabric is based,
lives under the most miserable conditions. The proletariat is badly clothed, badly
fed, miserably housed, exhausted by excessive and often deleterious labor, uncertain
as to income, and ignorant and coarse.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19483src" href="#xd31e19483">7</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb273a">[<a href="#pb273a">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, the sketch given above shows only one side of the question. At length the
workers have perceived that the interests of the employer are opposed to their own,
that the cause of their poverty lies in his luxury. They have begun to set up opposition
when they learn that by organizing themselves into labor unions they gain a power
by which they can ameliorate their lot. The work no longer being done separately as
in the time of the guilds, but together, there has been this consequence for the workmen,
that being now in the same position with regard to the capitalist, and in the same
social condition, they have gained in the feeling of solidarity and in discipline,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>two conditions which are essential to victory in the struggle. Little by little the
workers have learned that their enemy is not their own employer simply, but the whole
capitalist class. The strife has become a strife of classes. And capitalism being
international the conflict of the working class has become international also.
</p>
<p>The means by which the working class attempt to better their position are of various
kinds. First there are the unions, which undertake the contest for the shorter day
and higher wages. Then there is coöperation; and finally, and above all, politics.
The movement for unions, which could not exist without liberty of the press, of meeting,
and of forming associations, forces the working-men to take part in politics.
</p>
<p>At first, when they still had no clear idea of the position they occupied in society,
the working-men permitted other political parties to make use of them. But coming
to understand that the laborers form a class apart, whose interests are different
from those of other classes, they have formed an independent working-man’s party.
Finally, the contest of the working class could not limit itself to improvements brought
about within the frame-work of the existing economic system; if they wished to free
themselves permanently they saw themselves obliged to combat capitalism itself. Thus
modern socialism was born; on one side from an ardent desire of the working class
to free itself from the poverty caused by capitalism; on the other side from the development
in the manner of capitalistic production, in which small capital is always conquered
by large capital. The conviction becomes more and more general that capitalism has
fulfilled its historic task, the increase of the productive forces, and that the means
of production must belong to all if we are effectively to deliver humanity from the
material and intellectual miseries which result from capitalism. The labor movement
blends itself with socialism, then, and thus social democracy becomes the political
organization of the working class.
</p>
<p>What have been the results of the opposition made by the working class to the misery
imposed upon them by capitalism? When we compare the condition of the proletariat
in the first half of the nineteenth century (see, for example F. Engels, <i>op. cit.</i>) with that of today, we cannot help recognizing that it has been improved. Forced
(in order to avoid worse things) by the labor agitation and also by the ravages which
capitalism had caused in the working class, incapacitating them for the work required
of them, the bourgeoisie decided to put forth laws limiting the work of women and
children, <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>etc. The unions, consisting principally of skilled workers, have been and still are
able to obtain increase of wages and a shortening of the working-day, by making use
of the weapons at their disposal (strikes, etc.). Coöperation also has raised the
standard of living somewhat for those who have taken part in it.
</p>
<p>From the fact that the working class, in so far as it has been organized, has improved
its condition, the conclusion has wrongly been drawn that the distance between the
two parties, the possessors and the non-possessors, has been diminished. Those who
draw this conclusion forget that during this period the totality of wealth has been
enormously increased, and that the proletariat has obtained only a part, while the
rest has fallen to the bourgeoisie. And so far as I know, no one has yet been able
to prove that the part falling to the bourgeoisie must be smaller than that obtained
by the proletarians.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19670src" href="#xd31e19670">8</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the material consequences of the labor conflict, its spiritual consequences
are also of very high importance. The contest has obliged the working-men to develop
themselves, has taught them that they occupy an important place in society, and thus
has increased their confidence in themselves. It is socialism especially which, by
giving the hope of a better future to a whole class oppressed and poor, has had the
effect of little by little elevating the proletariat intellectually and morally.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I must speak now of the fourth and least numerous group of the population, that of
the very poor. Not possessing the means of production, and not being able to sell
their labor, these people occupy no position in the economic life properly speaking,
and their material condition is therefore easy to understand. Everything that has
been said upon this subject with reference to the proletariat applies here, but in
a much larger degree. The manner in which these people are fed, clothed, and housed
is almost indescribable. The middle class have no idea of such a life; they believe
that the pictures of <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>these conditions sometimes painted for them are exaggerated, and that charity is sufficient
to prevent their passing certain limits. From these limits we understand that the
bourgeoisie does not mean to be incommoded by the poor. If charity were to go farther
it would require sums so great that the increase of capital and expenditures for luxury
would be interfered with. That would be quite out of the question.
</p>
<p>In order to depict these conditions I wish to give but one quotation, taken from an
interesting article, “<span lang="de">Englands industrielle <span class="corr" id="xd31e19707" title="Source: Reserve-armée">Reservearmee</span></span>” in which account has been given of the researches of certain clergymen in the poorest
quarters of London. And everything that is here said of London applies in general
to other great cities. For capitalism produces the same effects everywhere.
</p>
<p>“Think of the condition in which the poor live. We do not say the condition of their
dwellings, for how can those holes be called dwellings, when in comparison with them
the lair of a wild beast would be a comfortable and healthful place. Only a few who
read these lines have any conception of what pestilential places these nests are,
where tens of thousands of human beings are herded together among horrors that recall
to us what we have heard of slave-ships between decks. To reach these abodes of misery
we have to find our way through hardly passable courts, impregnated with poisonous
and evil-smelling gases, which rise from the heaps of offal strewn around, and from
the dirty water flowing underfoot—courts, into which the sun seldom or never penetrates,
through which no breath of fresh air ever blows, and which seldom have the benefit
of a cleaning. We have rotten stairs to climb, which threaten to give way at each
step, and in some places have given way, leaving holes that endanger the lives and
limbs of those who are not accustomed to them. We are obliged to feel our way along
dark and dirty passages swarming with vermin; then, if we are not driven back by the
intolerable stench, we may enter the holes in which thousands of beings, of the same
race as ourselves, lodge together. Have you, dear reader, ever pitied those poor creatures
whom you found sleeping in the open under railway arches, in wagons or hogsheads,
or under anything that would afford them shelter? You will learn that these are to
be envied in comparison with those who seek refuge here. Eight feet square is the
average size of very many of these ‘living-rooms.’ Walls and ceiling are black with
the accumulation of dirt which has become fastened there through the neglect of years.
It falls down from the cracks in the ceiling, sticks out of the holes in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>walls, in short, is everywhere. What goes by the name of a window is half stuffed
up with rags or nailed up with boards, in order to keep out the wind and rain, while
the rest is so smeared and darkened that no light can get in, nor is it possible to
see out. If we climb up to an attic room, where at least we may expect a breath of
fresh air through an open or broken window, and look down upon the roofs or cornices
of the stories below, we shall discover that the already tainted air which might find
its entrance into the window, has come thither over the decayed bodies of cats, birds,
or still more nauseous things. The buildings themselves are in such miserable condition
that the thought naturally arises, ‘Will they fall down upon the heads of the inmates?’
And furniture? We shall perhaps discover a broken down chair, the rickety remains
of an old bedstead, or the mere fragments of a table; more often, however, as a substitute
for these we shall find only rough boards resting upon bricks, an old warped trunk,
or a box; and more often still nothing but rags and rubbish.
</p>
<p>“Every room in these rotten, damp, fetid houses is occupied by one, and often by two
families. A sanitary inspector reports that he found in a cellar a man, his wife,
three children, and four hogs. In another room a missionary found a man sick with
small-pox, his wife just recovering from child-birth, and the children half naked
and covered with dirt. Here seven persons live in a cellar-kitchen, and a dead child
lies between the living. In another room a poor widow was living with three children,
and one child who had already been dead thirteen days. Her husband, a cab-driver,
had committed suicide a short time before.—Here lives a widow and her six children,
including a daughter of 29, another of 21, and a son of 27. Another room contains
father, mother, and six children, of whom two are sick with scarlet fever. In another
live, eat, and sleep nine brothers and sisters from 29 years old down. Here is a mother
who sends her children out on the street from early evening till late after midnight,
because she rents her room during this time for immoral purposes. Afterwards the poor
worms may creep back to their dwelling if they have not found some scanty shelter
elsewhere. Where there is a bed it consists of nothing but a heap of dirty rags, refuse,
or straw, but mostly there is not even this, and the miserable beings lie upon the
dirty floor. The renter of this room is a widow, who takes the only bed herself and
sublets the floor to a married couple for two shillings sixpence a week.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19716src" href="#xd31e19716">10</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>“However miserable these rooms may be they are yet too dear for many, who wander about
all day seeking to get a living as well as they can, and at night take shelter in
one of the common lodging-houses, of which there are so many. The lodging-houses are
often the meeting place of thieves and vagabonds of the lowest sort, and some are
even kept by the receivers of stolen goods. In the kitchen men and women may be seen
cooking their food, doing their washing, or lounging around smoking and gambling.
In the sleeping room there is a long row of beds on each side, as many as sixty or
eighty in a single room. In many lodging-houses the two sexes are permitted to lodge
together without any regard for the commonest decency. Yet there is still a lower
step. Hundreds cannot procure even the twopence necessary to secure the privilege
of passing a night in the stuffy air of these dormitories; and so they lie down on
the steps and in the passage ways, where it is nothing uncommon in the early morning
to find six or eight human beings huddled together or stretched out.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19725src" href="#xd31e19725">11</a>
</p>
<p>We may limit ourselves to this sketch of the habitation—all the other living conditions
conform thereto. With so miserable a material life there can be no question of the
intellectual life. Continual poverty and the permanent fear of dying of hunger destroy
all that is noble in man and reduce him to the condition of a beast, without any aspiration
for higher things; for those who have come to this state from the more favored classes
become more and more degraded and have soon lost the little knowledge they acquired
in earlier periods. Servility and lack of self-respect are necessary to the poor if
they are to get the alms they need to keep them alive, since they occupy no place
in the economic life. Between them and the workers there is an enormous difference;
they have no feeling of solidarity in the social life.
</p>
<p>What is the origin of the lower proletariat, from what classes is it recruited? If
we are to believe many criminologists and sociologists the answer to this question
ought to be that their poverty is not due to social conditions but exclusively to
themselves; that they are inferior by nature. But to get a true answer we must put
the question in this way: do the existing social classes form the groups into which
men would be classified according to their qualities?
<span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those who give an affirmative answer to this question reason as follows: men differ
enormously among themselves in their innate capacities. The largest division of them
is made up of people of moderate worth, a small number rise above this, and the rest
are inferior. Circumstances have little influence upon the development of these capacities.
If any man has great abilities circumstances cannot keep him from the place to which
they entitle him. He who has little ability also arrives at the place which that fact
makes his own. In other words (to confine myself to capitalism) the bourgeoisie, the
ruling class, is composed of persons predestined to rule; next comes the petty bourgeoisie,
followed by the proletariat, predestined to rough work; and finally lower proletariat,
a class predestined to succumb in the struggle for existence, since incapable of meeting
its requirements.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19778src" href="#xd31e19778">12</a>
</p>
<p>An attentive examination of this theory, which is an application to society of the
Darwinian theory of selection, shows at once—even supposing it to be correct—that
there is an important difference between the struggle for existence in nature and
that in society. In nature the conquered are either annihilated, or are prevented
from reproducing themselves, while in society the lower classes multiply much faster
than the higher. It is no longer a question of the survival of the most fit, and the
annihilation of the rest, as in nature.
</p>
<p>Who is it then who remains victor in the struggle for life in society? To answer this
it is necessary first to answer another, Are the chances the same for all? If this
is not the case then it cannot be a question of the triumph of the best.
</p>
<p>There are few questions upon which opinions differ as much as upon this. Generally
these opinions are only conjectures, for they are not based upon an examination of
facts. For this reason I wish to set down here briefly the very important conclusions
of Professor Odin in his “<span lang="fr">Genèse des grands hommes</span>”, a work noteworthy not simply from the wealth of documents of which the author made
use, but also from his very scrupulous care in examining them. Professor Odin has
made studies of the educational environment, the economic environment, the ethnological
environment, etc., of all the men of letters born in France between 1300 and 1830,
to the number of 6382.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>As to educational environment, the author has been able to procure exact information
with regard to 827 persons; a good education had been given to 811, or 98.1 % and
16, or 1.9 % had had a poor education. “All this forces us to admit that education
plays a rôle not only important, but capital, decisive, in the development of the
man of letters.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19810src" href="#xd31e19810">13</a>
</p>
<p>The economic environment in which the men of letters had passed their youth could
be discovered in the case of 619. Of these, 562, or 90.7 %, passed their youth sheltered
from all material care, while 57, or 9.3 %, passed their youth in indigence or insecurity.
In consequence the author makes the following observation: “As it appears, only the
eleventh part of the literary men of talent have passed their youth in difficult economic
conditions. This ratio, already very small in itself, appears much more striking when
we strive to represent the numerical relation which ought to exist for the whole population
between well-do-do families and those that are not. It is impossible to say, doubtless,
what this relation has been on the average for the whole modern period. But it is
clear that we shall be well below the truth if we admit that the families of the second
category are three or four times as numerous as those of the first. That is to say,
from the mere fact of the economic conditions in which they are born, the children
of well-to-do families have at least forty or fifty times as much chance of making
a name in letters as do those who belong to families that are poor, or are simply
in a position of economic instability.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19817src" href="#xd31e19817">14</a>
</p>
<p>Further, the author shows that the fifty-seven men of letters who passed their youth
in an unfavorable economic environment were by chance put in a position to develop
their capacities. (Only five of them received a poor education.)
</p>
<p>Finally the social environment from which the literary men have sprung:

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>Upon examining these figures we see that of two persons of the same innate qualities
the one who has sprung from the nobility has about 200 times as much chance of becoming
a person of importance as the one who comes from the laboring class. The struggle
of our day has been characterized as a race with a handicap, in which one runs on
foot with a burden on his back, another rides a horse, while the third takes an express
train. The reality, however, is still stronger.
</p>
<p>Doubtless we must not forget that the researches of Professor Odin include in part
a period that differs in many respects from our own (hence the small contingent of
the bourgeoisie), and that since this time education has become more solid and more
general, a fact which increases the chances of success of a gifted man sprung from
a poor environment. In the second place it was literary men and not capitalists who
were the subject of investigation, and since the former doubtless must have greater
natural aptitudes than the latter, it may well be that it is easier for anyone without
money to acquire capital, than would be suggested by the figures applying only to
men of letters. Nevertheless, all this does not overthrow the fact that the researches
of Professor Odin have proved that the fact of being born in a class where youth is
without care, and enjoys a good education, procures an enormous advantage in the struggle
for existence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19867src" href="#xd31e19867">15</a>
</p>
<p>In order to prevent erroneous interpretations I will add Professor Odin’s own conclusion,
from which it is plain that he does not deny absolutely that men’s innate capacities
differ widely (which, indeed, is disputed by few, and may be considered settled).
“Heredity and environment,” he says, concur with one another in the development of
talent. We may characterize as follows their respective spheres of action: where the
hereditary qualities are identical—to suppose an impossible case—it is the environment
which causes all the difference between individuals; where the environment is identical,
it is heredity.
</p>
<p>“Put in these terms the proposition is banal. What is less so, since this has been
established here with certainty for perhaps the <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>first time, is that heredity alone can do nothing. However strong may be the natural
disposition given by heredity, it can only develop itself in a favorable environment.
Thrown into an unfavorable environment it will become weakened in the degree in which
the environment is contrary to it, and may even end by being atrophied to the point
of being no longer perceptible. The supposed omnipotence of heredity is only an illusion,
resulting from an elementary confusion between heredity and simple parentage.
</p>
<p>“This is not all. We have been able to determine more nearly what is the indispensable
environment for the development of literary talent. It is a good education, made possible
by certain circumstances which are advantageous socially and economically, in other
words, a proper social environment.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19894src" href="#xd31e19894">16</a>
</p>
<p>As a second form of the handicap we must speak of inheritance. It is impossible to
estimate this advantage in figures, but it is incontestable that the man who has become
rich in this way has no need of great knowledge or great intelligence in order to
remain rich. Provided he does not speculate or squander his money, he should be able
to have the enjoyment of it all his life. The struggle for existence is unknown to
him; at the very start of the race his foot is nearly at the goal.
</p>
<p>We see already that these two circumstances have as their result that the classes
do not correspond exactly to the groups into which men are separated according to
their capacities. However we must now leave the cases in which one has a start of
another, and give an answer to the question, “In what do the conquerors in the contest
excel?”
</p>
<p>In the first place, attention must be drawn to a group of capitalists who have acquired
their wealth without having their abilities called into play, but who are entirely
indebted to chance, <i>i.e.</i> the speculators, the winners of the great prizes in lotteries, the men who make rich
marriages, etc. Next we may mention the other capitalists, the great manufacturers
and merchants. Wherein are they distinguished? First for energy and activity, next
for a great talent for organization, especially as shown in the choice of their chief
employes, and finally for a need of luxury, not too great, lest the building up of
their capital be interfered with, nor too restrained, lest the suspicion be aroused
that their fortune is in danger. The first of these aptitudes must certainly be considered
as the most favorable; the <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>talent for organization especially is of the highest importance, for it is without
contradiction a factor in social progress. It is because of this talent and not for
their fabulous wealth alone that the names of Pierpont Morgan, of Rockefeller, and
of other directors of trusts will not be entirely forgotten after they are dead. But
these are not the only capacities which these people must display. To direct a capitalistic
enterprise it is necessary among other things to have a fair portion of insensibility
as well toward workmen as toward customers; then it will not do to be too scrupulous
about truth (in advertising, etc.), nor to show too much character (however impertinent
his customers may be the capitalist takes it all through fear of seeing them go over
to his competitors).
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he who displays all these qualities, still is not entirely sure of being
able to improve his position, or even to maintain himself in it; crises, as has been
shown, are inevitably bound up with capitalism itself, and strike at times the most
substantial and energetic capitalists. By a new invention or a new manner of working
the most active and intelligent manufacturer may see himself out-stripped by a competitor.
And aside from all fortuitous circumstances, in society as it exists today the struggle
for existence is a struggle between those best armed, those who have the best machines,
etc. But the manufacturer who can procure the best machines, who can bring his establishment
up to the latest technical requirements, who can procure the services of the ablest
technicians, etc., is the man who has most capital. The struggle is not a struggle
of men but of capital.
</p>
<p>In his work, “<span lang="de">Die <span class="corr" id="xd31e19912" title="Source: Darwinische">Darwinsche</span> Theorie und der Sozialismus</span>” Dr. L. Woltmann has brought out clearly the difference between the combat in nature
and that which takes place in society. He says: “The history of the civilization of
the human race also proceeds upon the basis of the great biological principles of
adaptation, transmission, and perfection in the struggle for existence. But between
the application of these principles among the lower animals and in the world of man
there are the following essential differences. In the first place in the animal world
the struggle for existence takes place through the adaptation of organic means to
organic ends, while with men technical tools and economical means of production enter
in, things which are not within the power of separate individuals, but are made possible
by association. In the second place hereditary transmission in the case of animals
is organic, while in the case of human beings <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>there is added an external and legally determined hereditary transmission of technical
tools and of capital. In the animal kingdom, in the third place, the struggle for
existence is a rivalry of organic production and reproduction, while among men, especially
under the capitalistic order, there takes place a competition in commodities and places,
a contest for profit, which has hardly anything in common with natural selection.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19918src" href="#xd31e19918">17</a>
</p>
<p>Thus we see clearly who it is that can rise from the class of non-possessors to that
of possessors: it is those to whom fortune is peculiarly favorable, or who, possessing
the qualities necessary for the capitalist, meet with the opportunity of putting them
in evidence. Those who are dropped from the capitalist class are those who have been
unfortunate or who do not possess the qualities necessary for capitalists.
</p>
<p>The answer to the question proposed, “Are the present classes also the groups where
men can be ranked according to their qualities”, must be decidedly negative. The bourgeoisie
is not the ruling class because the most intelligent and energetic persons are found
among its members. There are also included in this class persons without energy, stupid
people, of minor importance in short, just as in the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat
very capable persons may be met with. The fact of being excluded from the class of
possessors is not a proof of inferiority. If the superior persons were those who led
society they would be the great thinkers, the savants, for it is they who have made
society progress and who have desired its well-being. For even if capitalists, more
than others, have aided progress, it is by chance, for they have always had in view
only their own profit.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19924src" href="#xd31e19924">18</a>
</p>
<p>I could easily cite a number of celebrated authors who are unanimously of the opinion
that the conquerors in the present struggle are not such because they are naturally
superior.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19938src" href="#xd31e19938">19</a> I will confine myself to recalling the opinion of one whose authority no one will
contest, namely, Charles Darwin. Here is what Wallace says: “In one of my last conversations
with Darwin he expressed himself as having very little hope of the future of humanity,
and this upon the <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>basis of his observation that in our modern civilization natural selection does not
occur, and the fittest does not survive. The victors in the struggle for gold are
by no means the best or the most intelligent, and it is a well known fact that our
population reproduces itself in each generation much more rapidly among the lower
than among the middle and upper classes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e19960src" href="#xd31e19960">20</a>
</p>
<p>An examination of the struggle for existence in the middle class shows that everything
which happens in the bourgeoisie on a large scale is reproduced here on a small scale.
He who has little capital is surpassed by a competitor who has more, even though the
former may be entirely fitted for his business; crises have the same ruinous influence
here, and strike skilful and unskilful alike. The difference, as far as the struggle
for existence is concerned, between the class in question and the bourgeoisie, consists
in this: the less energetic, the less intelligent of the middle class runs more danger
of falling back out of the ranks than a member of the bourgeoisie who is his equal.
</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the proletariat. Here also there is an elimination of individuals
not because they are incapable, but because they are superfluous in the present mode
of production, as well as of those whom sickness or old age render unfit for labor.
Here we must take account of a factor which is of less importance in the other classes,
bodily health and strength. While the proletarian has need neither of much knowledge
or great intelligence to carry on his trade, he has a powerful weapon for the struggle
in his muscular strength and health. Unfavorable conditions have a strong influence
upon him, and the one who is weak and ailing must, other things being equal, yield
in the present struggle for existence to a competitor who is stronger and in better
health. And finally, in this contest also the less active, the less persevering among
the workers will have the smaller chance of success, supposing conditions to be equal.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>So we return to the point from which we set out, the lower proletariat. This class
is not composed, then, as has sometimes been claimed, of beings inferior by nature,
of persons who are fit for nothing. In the great majority of cases social conditions
and not their lack of aptitude, are the exclusive and direct causes of their position.
In support of this I will give some figures, which also show the relative importance
of the causes compared among themselves.

</p>
<p>This table shows that 44.32% of the persons assisted were “co-assisted”; that 8.8%
have become indigent through the death or injury of the <span class="corr" id="xd31e20148" title="Source: bread-winner">breadwinner</span> of the family; that there are, therefore, 53.12% of those assisted the cause of whose
indigence is not to be found in the persons themselves, but in their social environment.
(Generally such persons are spoken of as not being poor through their “own fault”,
a term so vague that it would be well to discontinue its use.) 1.34% are persons with
a large family, whose wages are too small to support so many; 2.23% are out of employment,
<i>i.e.</i> they wish to work but can find nothing to do; 12.32% are prevented from working by
old age. Consequently we reach the figure of 69.01% for those who have become indigent
through causes which do not depend upon themselves. Finally come 25.25% of those assisted
who have been injured, or are sick, or have bodily or intellectual infirmities.
</p>
<p>Further, there are social causes which play a great part in the etiology of the cases
we have been discussing (bad housing conditions favoring tuberculosis, lack of protective
devices for dangerous machines, causing injuries, etc.). Others of these persons are
born weak <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>or sickly, in which case we may speak of individual causes of poverty, although social
conditions have contributed in their turn by their influence on the parents to make
the children wretched.
</p>
<p>It is, however, a social phenomenon that the sick and weak of the proletariat are
left to shift for themselves. They find themselves in that condition only because
they do not possess the means of production, and are no longer in a condition to sell
their labor. Many times we read in treatises upon morals how shameful it is that nomadic
peoples abandon or kill their sick and aged, and how by these customs they give proof
of their inferior morality. But those who speak in this way forget how, notwithstanding
our present civilization, a great number of persons still pass their old age in the
direst poverty; they forget also that the manner in which the nomadic peoples live
forces them to rid themselves of their sick and aged, because it would be impossible
to take them with them; they forget also that, on account of the limited power that
nomads have over nature, they find themselves in exceedingly difficult material circumstances,
so that their manner of acting is not judged immoral by any of their own families
who suffer by it;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20159src" href="#xd31e20159">23</a> finally they forget that the productivity of labor is so enormous at present that
all the sick and aged could be supported; a part of the money spent in superfluous
luxuries would be ample for this purpose.
</p>
<p>We have still to examine the last two headings, laziness and alcoholism. As the figures
given above show, these form a very small part of the causes: together only 1.59%.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20166src" href="#xd31e20166">24</a> Among the causes which have brought these persons to the point where they are, there
are social factors also. Later on I shall speak of the relation between the present
economic system and alcoholism. But at this point we may say as regards the 0.71%
of persons who do not wish to work <span class="pageNum" id="pb288a">[<a href="#pb288a">288</a>]</span>that a part of them—it is impossible to say just how many—have grown up in a bad environment,
where they have never been given the habit of working regularly and diligently, so
that they have become totally incapable of doing so.
</p>
<p>There is still another social factor that may be named; the disagreeable character
of many kinds of work, made worse by long hours and low wages. To adduce but one example:
the miner is obliged to work in a vitiated atmosphere, often in a painful position,
and constantly surrounded by dangers, and this for very low wages. If we stop to think
of this we are more astonished at the millions of workers who pass their lives under
similar conditions, than at the comparatively few who refuse to work.
</p>
<p>However, taking all this into account, it is certain that there are among the proletariat
persons who are predisposed to idleness by their congenital constitution. It is indubitable
that these persons are invalids, who would be cared for in a well-organized society,
but in ours are abandoned to their fate. Professor Benedikt says, in speaking of physical
neurasthenia: “It represents not so much absolute weakness as speedy exhaustion coupled
with a painful feeling of weakness. We make in our childhood more muscular movements
than is necessary, and out of the pleasurable feeling which comes from these develop
the first elements of pleasure in work. If, however, the child quickly becomes weary,
and the muscular action soon begets a lively feeling of discomfort, there arises from
this discomfort laziness or physical neurasthenia.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20306src" href="#xd31e20306">25</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>The number of those the cause of whose poverty is to be found in themselves is not,
then, very considerable. Nevertheless it is a little greater than the statistics given
would lead one to suppose, for there are also certain of the bourgeoisie and petty
bourgeoisie, ruined in consequence of the lack of the qualities required for success,
who have gone down little by little and have finally become incorporated with the
lower proletariat.
</p>
<p>But is this class of poor persons absolutely fit for nothing? It seems to me that
(leaving the sick out of consideration) the answer must be decidedly in the negative.
It is true that a part of this group succumbs in the struggle because it is inferior.
But it would be as absurd to say of the runner who comes in last in a race that he
cannot run at all, as to say of the man who goes under in the struggle for existence
that he is fit for nothing. Those who do not succeed in life are in great part those
who through accident of birth have not obtained the place for which their talents
fitted them. How many among the bourgeoisie are ruined from their incapacity for directing
a business enterprise, while they would have become useful members of society if they
had been able to follow their true vocation? And how many proletarians have fallen
lower and lower through not being fitted for the trade to which their birth destined
them, while their innate qualities predestined them to a different form of work?<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20321src" href="#xd31e20321">26</a>
</p>
<p>Side by side with these there are individuals who are really inferior, who have little
energy, intelligence, etc. It would be absurd to claim that these persons are capable
of doing great things, even in the most favorable circumstances. But there is a great
difference between not being able to do great things, and being absolutely useless,
as are the members of the lower proletariat under present conditions. These persons
have need of being guided, cannot stand up without support, and in order not to perish
need to find themselves in a favorable environment. If their neighbor comes to their
assistance they can assuredly become sufficiently useful, and in any case need do
no harm. Anyone who will look about him may be convinced of the truth of this; for
many persons of just this sort, happening to belong to the bourgeoisie, have succeeded
very well.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Ethnology points out also that classes have not their origin in the universal fact
that men differ in their innate qualities. For if this were true classes would be
as old as humanity itself. This, however, is not the case; it has been proved that
in the evolution of society <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>there has been a stage (that it was a long time ago makes little difference) when
riches and poverty were unknown, and classes did not exist.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20337src" href="#xd31e20337">27</a> The assertion that the “war of all against all” is a natural phenomenon, is absolutely
false, and proves a very great lack of sociological knowledge. It is certain that
classes have long existed, but a society like that of our time, in which we can apply
the adage of Hobbes, that “man is a wolf to his fellowman”, is of comparatively recent
date.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Our conclusion, then, is this: the groups into which the population of capitalistic
countries is divided do not originate in the circumstance that men differ in their
innate capacities, but in the system of production that is in force; it is chiefly
chance that determines to which class an individual belongs; there are inferior beings
in each group, but among the lower proletariat they are more numerous than elsewhere;
but these inferior beings may still be useful enough on condition that they be placed
in a favorable environment.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As between the two commonplaces, “There have always been poor people”, and “The present
institution of marriage springs from human nature itself and is as old as society”,
it is hard to say which is repeated oftenest, but it is quite certain that one is
no more exact than the other. Sociology has proved that marriage, as it exists at
present, is the result of a long process of evolution, and every serious observer
must be convinced that its present form will be no more constant than those which
preceded it, and that the ideas concerning it have undergone important modifications.
</p>
<p>The question to solve is this: “How has monogamy taken its rise?” With the aid of
sociology I shall endeavor to give the answer as summarily as possible.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20371src" href="#xd31e20371">28</a> It will, however, be necessary to recall the ancient forms of marriage, without which
it would be impossible to grasp the origin and evolution of the present form. Most
sociologists are of the opinion that primitive man lived in promiscuity, which, if
true, must have been in the most remote period, when man was hardly distinguishable
from the anthropoid apes. Other authors, <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>on the contrary, have attempted to show that such a state of things has never existed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20433src" href="#xd31e20433">29</a> However, the only thing proved is that no case of promiscuity has ever been established
among peoples observed by serious ethnologists. But all these peoples, however far
removed they may be from us, had already attained a certain degree of development,
and were by no means in their primitive state. No amount of observation can prove
whether or not primitive man really lived in a state of promiscuity, and we can only
take refuge in hypotheses.
</p>
<p>We shall be getting at the truth when we come to an agreement as to the meaning of
the word “promiscuity.” Do we mean by this a state like that in which dogs live, where
after copulation the male and female do not remain together at all? Then it is very
likely that human beings have never lived in that state, inasmuch as such promiscuity
exists rarely or not at all among the animals most approaching man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20456src" href="#xd31e20456">30</a> If, on the contrary, we mean by promiscuity a state in which rules concerning the
sexual life are lacking, but where life in common for a longer or shorter period is
not excluded, then, since man is part of the animal kingdom, it is most probable that
there has been a time when this state has existed, and that it is only little by little
that objective rules have appeared.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20464src" href="#xd31e20464">31</a> Let us now leave the domain of hypothesis and examine the real facts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20480src" href="#xd31e20480">32</a>
</p>
<p>The most primitive of the peoples who have been observed in detail have been named
“lower hunters”; they include the Australian aborigines, the Veddhas, the Botocudos,
etc. Among these peoples the men hunt while the women gather fruit and roots. They
are forced to wander in small groups in order to provide for their needs, as otherwise
the game and fruit would soon fail. Their limited control over nature is a frequent
cause of famine and distress generally, and thus prevents any considerable increase
in the population.
</p>
<p>As to their sexual relations, there could not be any question of <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>promiscuity among these peoples. Each horde is divided into three age-classes, and
the union of a member of one of these classes with a member of another is forbidden.
The cause of this prohibition is not certain. Grosse<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20502src" href="#xd31e20502">33</a> (as well as other authors<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20506src" href="#xd31e20506">34</a>) is of the opinion that it lies in the fact that these peoples discovered the unfavorable
effects of consanguineous unions upon the children, and that this discovery led to
the prohibition.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20517src" href="#xd31e20517">35</a> Other authors believe that the hordes which practiced this exclusion, without suspecting
its importance, ran less danger of extinction than those which did not practice it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20527src" href="#xd31e20527">36</a>
</p>
<p>The hordes being composed of but few persons, this exclusion would force the men more
and more to seek wives from outside the horde, thus little by little becoming a group
of consanguineous persons with whom union is forbidden. If a man has procured a woman
by capture he becomes her absolute owner, can maltreat her, abandon her, do what he
likes in short. The power of the man over his wife is less great if he has acquired
her by purchase or exchange, since her family then exercises a certain control.
</p>
<p>The relation of the sexes is sufficiently explained by the mode of production. When
these savages are on the march the woman carries the little that they possess, erects
the tent, and searches for fruit; the man on the other hand by his natural qualities
is fitted for hunting and for the defense of the hunting ground. Hunting being the
principal resource, and in this period bodily strength being of the highest importance,
it is natural that the man should rule.
</p>
<p>The so-called “higher hunters”, among whom we must reckon the North American Indians
of the northwest coast and some peoples of northern Asia, have reached a higher stage
of social evolution. The difference between these and the preceding class is only
quantitative, and results from the circumstance that they have been able to settle
themselves in countries that are rich in game and fish. This permits <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>them to be more sedentary, to live in larger groups, and to attain a higher development.
</p>
<p>As with the lower hunters there is among them a division of labor between men and
women: The man hunts, fishes, and constructs the tools that he has need of; the woman
gathers roots and herbs, prepares the food, and gives herself up to the duties of
the household. Some of these peoples are capable of producing more than they need,
a fact which occasions commerce of some importance, and produces at times a great
inequality of fortune.
</p>
<p>At this stage of development the woman is of great use, which brings it about that
the father does not give his daughter but sells her. Since the man, then, has bought
his wife she has become his property, and he can do with her as he wishes; her infidelity
is punished with death. If the husband has received gifts of value from his father-in-law,
he is a little limited in his power, since, if he wishes to repudiate his wife, he
is obliged to return the gifts. However repudiation is rare, since the woman is very
useful to the man and he has ordinarily paid very dear for her. This is also why polygyny,
though permitted almost everywhere, is rare. Only the very rich can permit themselves
the luxury of more than one wife.
</p>
<p>The position of the wife is rather better when, instead of following her husband,
he comes to live at her father’s house. This happens sometimes when the man cannot
pay the whole purchase price, sometimes when the father-in-law is much richer than
he. In this latter case the son-in-law prefers to profit by the wealth and power of
his wife’s father, who, for his part, asks nothing better than to keep his daughter
at home, since, in this manner, instead of losing a worker from the household he gains
one by the coming of the husband.
</p>
<p>We come now to the “pastoral peoples”, living principally in Asia and Africa. Just
as hunting is not the sole resource of the preceding groups, so the raising of cattle
is not the exclusive occupation of this group, but simply the principal one; hence
their name. The raising of cattle is naturally the work of the men, seeing that it
proceeds genetically from hunting, while the women in this class, as in the preceding,
gather fruits and herbs and attend to the work of the household. Although the land
is held in common, there are great diversities of wealth, since cattle, the principal
form of possession, are individual property, and since war and pillage are also frequent
sources of wealth.
</p>
<p>Polygyny is permitted, and nomads take as many wives as they can pay for and support.
Only the rich, however, can afford to purchase more than one wife, for the fathers
demand a good price. <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>Once purchased the woman becomes the absolute property of the man, who can exploit
her in any manner, or abandon her, and when he comes to die can leave her to his heirs
with the rest of his possessions. Adultery on the part of the woman is severely punished,
while the man is free. Often under polygyny only one of the women is considered the
legitimate wife and her children have the sole right to inherit, while the other women
are considered only as concubines. The position of the legitimate wife towards her
husband does not prevent her being as much of a slave as the other women. Nowhere
else has the woman as humble a place as among these pastoral peoples, and nowhere
else is the rôle of the man as important as here.
</p>
<p>Let us next examine the “lower agriculturists” (among whom are to be found the greater
number of the North American Indians, and a great number of the peoples of Africa
and the East Indies). When hunting peoples, through chance circumstances (wealth of
game for example), have ceased to wander continually, they may easily pass into agriculturists.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20551src" href="#xd31e20551">37</a> Agriculture in its turn brings it about that those who practice it become more and
more sedentary.
</p>
<p>The cultivation of the soil developed in connection with the gathering of fruit and
roots, so that it originally formed part of woman’s sphere of labor; hence the economic
importance of women increased, and a father became less and less disposed to give
his daughter in marriage for a small equivalent. The future husband is obliged to
acquire his wife at a considerable price, perhaps may have to win her by serving his
father-in-law temporarily. Thus, although polygyny is permitted it is only the rich
and the chiefs who can procure more than one wife.
</p>
<p>Since agriculture requires many hands, the parents try to keep their children with
them as long as possible.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20567src" href="#xd31e20567">38</a> Thus the custom grows up of several families living in the same house, and the husband
comes to live with his wife’s family when he is unable to pay the purchase price.
Even if this is not the case, a close relationship exists between the wife and her
family, so that she returns to it with her children when her husband dies. The more
important the position of the woman in the family becomes, the more it comes to pass
that the married woman remains in her own family and the husband in his, and that
the union consists only in more or less frequent visits paid by the man to his wife.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the position of woman at this stage is in general <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>better than at those which preceded. Ordinarily it is the woman who tills the soil
and cares for the household, while the man hunts and prepares the necessary tools;
and since agriculture gives a more regular and surer production than hunting, it follows
that the position of woman is improved. The woman becomes less dependent upon the
man, to such a point that, for example, she is able to break the marriage, a condition
very different from those in which the wife was the property of her husband. (The
somewhat numerous exceptions are explained by the fact that in those cases the man
takes part in the cultivation of the soil.) This is especially the case when a domestic
community is formed in which the women govern (matriarchate).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20579src" href="#xd31e20579">39</a> Thus a situation is developed at times in which the women have an important position
even outside of the family (gynecocracy).
</p>
<p>As the preceding considerations show it is not the family which, at this stage of
development, takes the first place. During the periods which I have examined before
this the clan (in Latin “<span lang="la">gens</span>”, in German “<span lang="de">Sippe</span>”), a group of persons descended from a common ancestor, is of importance only inasmuch
as members of the clan are forbidden to marry among themselves. Among the lower agriculturists,
however, the clan is developed into a consanguineous group living in a community,
and in most cases the clan is maternal—that is, descent and the right of succession
are reckoned in the maternal line.
</p>
<p>However as soon as agriculture increased greatly in importance, especially when the
raising of cattle, commerce, and industry grew up beside it, the relation between
the sexes became considerably modified. The man gave up hunting, always a less important
resource at this stage, and applied himself more and more to agriculture and other
branches, and the woman only seconded him in these occupations. In consequence of
the continually increasing productivity of labor, the man could produce more than
he needed for consumption. The possession of slaves then became advantageous, slavery
took on greater and greater proportions, and in this way the woman’s part in the economic
life became less important. Thus the man becomes anew the principal factor and his
authority resumes the force it had in the earlier periods. It is no longer the man
who lives with the woman and her family but she lives with him. We have seen above
<span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>that among the lower agriculturists it is the clan, and especially the maternal clan,
that holds the first place. Through the economic development the maternal clan is
made to give place to the paternal clan. In the clan there was equality, since the
soil, the most important means of production, and the dwelling were possessed in common;
but the disappearance of this equality followed the development of commerce and industry,
for the products of these were, from the first, private property. This inequality
was increased still more because private property in land began to grow up side by
side with property in common. In the second place, the booty in war was not the same
for all warriors, and furthermore war brought about the existence of a class of persons
(slaves) whose interests were opposed to those of the conquerors. This development
of private property leads necessarily to a gradual change from the maternal clan to
the paternal. For in the first case a father had to leave his property to the members
of his clan (we have seen that it was the man who became the possessor of private
wealth); and since his children belonged always to another clan than his own, the
clan of their mother, the children did not inherit from their father. Hence the change
to the paternal clan.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20603src" href="#xd31e20603">40</a>
</p>
<p>But this was not all. Through the great modifications in the mode of production of
which I have already spoken, the importance of the clan diminished more and more,
and at length disappeared entirely. As long as there was equality among the members
of the clan, as long as the social relationships were little complicated, the clan
and the organizations that sprang from it (mere combinations of clans) sufficed for
the purposes of social organization. But such an organization, being purely democratic
in its nature, was no longer adapted to a society in which there were rich and poor,
freemen and slaves, in which, therefore, there was a large group of persons oppressed
and a small group of oppressors.
</p>
<p>The clan and the combinations of the different clans were replaced by the state. This
was an organization which had for its principal end the maintenance of order as far
as possible, in a society in which the interests of different groups, like those of
individuals, were opposed to each other, and the regulation of this conflict of interests.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20614src" href="#xd31e20614">41</a> This organization is consequently entirely different from the clan, the object of
which was to take the interests of the community to <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>heart. It is evident that in an organization like this it is the most important and
influential class which comes first.
</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, the clan loses itself in the state; on the other hand the family,
which played but a secondary part while the clan system was at its height, became
of greater importance. The clan is divided into “great families” (“<span lang="de">Grossfamilien</span>”), <i>i.e.</i> husband, wife, and their unmarried children as well as their male descendants, with
their wives and children; and the father is the master of all these persons and all
their property. However it is only little by little, and in proportion as we get away
from the clan, that the authority of the father becomes unlimited. This form of the
family has continued even down to our own day in China and Japan, and was general
during the early days of ancient Rome.
</p>
<p>In China the woman, whose work is entirely limited to household occupations, has a
position which, according to all accounts, is only that of a subordinate. Her whole
life is under the direction of her husband; she can never obtain a divorce, while
her husband can dissolve the marriage without cause; if he takes her in the act of
adultery he has the right to kill her, while he himself may keep concubines. In Japan
the position of woman is much the same, and in ancient Rome also, though in the course
of time the situation of the Roman woman was improved.
</p>
<p>As the method of production became more elaborate and the social life was modified
as a consequence, the “great family” disappeared, to be replaced by the modern family,
consisting of the husband and wife with their unmarried children. Through the increasing
extension of the division of labor the sons could more easily provide for their own
needs and withdraw themselves in this way from the paternal authority, and the increasing
power of the state favored this tendency by limiting the authority of the father.
</p>
<p>The best sources for the study of the first phases of monogamous marriage are furnished
by ancient Greece. There absolute submission of the woman to the man still prevailed.
After the decease of the husband the woman was under the guardianship of his son.
The man could repudiate his wife or give her to another. While he had full liberty
to have intercourse with other women, the woman who committed adultery was severely
punished. The occupations of the woman were confined to spinning, weaving, and housekeeping;
her life was concentrated within the house, though even there her authority was very
limited, while outside it had no force whatever.
</p>
<p>In comparing the position of woman during the period in question <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>with that in the earlier periods (excepting the lower agricultural period) we see
that in general her condition is but little ameliorated. Monogamy existed in reality
for one of the parties only, since the man was free to keep concubines, while he took
every means in his power to prevent the infidelity of his wife, by isolating her from
the outer world. Hence it is not true, as some would have us believe, that monogamy
is the consequence of an instinct, nor that it is due to a higher degree of culture,
made possible by the increased productivity of labor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20653src" href="#xd31e20653">42</a> On the contrary, among the lower agriculturists, much less civilized than the ancient
Greeks, the position of women was better than with the latter; being more free, the
woman enjoyed in general a higher degree of consideration.
</p>
<p>The origin of monogamy is explained only by the modifications that the mode of production
has undergone. Through these the man has again taken the most important place in the
economic life, it is he who governs and the woman has only to obey him. Thus it is
that through the continual increase of private property monogamy sprung up, that is
to say the union of a man and a woman with the object of producing legitimate children
who might inherit the property of the father.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20661src" href="#xd31e20661">43</a>
</p>
<p>Since that time monogamy has persisted to our own day. However important the modifications
which the method of production has undergone since the rise of monogamy, the fact
remains that a certain part of the work necessary to existence belongs still to the
work of housekeeping, which, as at other times, is performed by the women. The more
important labors, those which give the greater social power to him who executes them,
fall upon the man, and from this fact his preponderance still persists.
</p>
<p>Though the position of the married woman may be somewhat improved when compared with
that at the beginning of civilization, nevertheless a study of existing civil codes
(especially of the French civil code and of those for which it has served as a model)
shows that the married woman is in general still in a state of great dependence. The
woman must obey her husband and follow him wherever he wishes; except where otherwise
stipulated in the marriage contract the husband has the management of his wife’s fortune
and the income from it belongs to him; it is the man who exercises parental authority;
the woman cannot appear in a lawsuit without the assistance of her husband; etc.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>The difference between the position of the married woman of today and that of former
times consists principally in that the consent of both parties is necessary to conclude
the marriage, that the husband can no longer repudiate his wife, but can only dissolve
the union for important reasons (adultery, cruelty, etc.), and that the woman also,
for the same reasons, can obtain separation or divorce.
</p>
<p>This raises the question as to why a marriage should not be dissolved as soon as for
any reason the union becomes intolerable to either party. The answer must be as follows.
From the dominant position of the man in the economic life it is clear that the woman
would not be able to loose the bonds of marriage at her pleasure, except in the case
provided by law, inasmuch as the man could not permit so grave an assault upon his
authority. From this point of view monogamy and the ancient forms of marriage are
alike, for the woman has never been able to secure a divorce at her own pleasure except
among the lower agriculturists, where, on account of her importance in the economic
life she enjoyed the same rights as the man. The present organization of society prevents
the man, for his part, from getting a divorce except in certain cases provided by
law, for if it were possible for the husband to break the marriage at will, society
today would not have the necessary solidity and stability; marriage would be a very
hazardous enterprise for the woman, since, from the nature of her occupation, she
is generally not in a position to provide for her own needs by herself; and the support
and education of the children by their parents would also be less assured. But even
this is not all. As we have seen, monogamy was created as soon as private property
became general. Reciprocally monogamy is one of the causes which support and increase
the spirit of property in men. It is in the narrow circle of the family, away from
the contact with society, that a keen desire to possess is developed among children.
</p>
<p>The deepest roots of marriage as it exists today are found in our present state of
society, based as it is on private property; and, in its turn, marriage is a support
for that society. Here is also the reason for the disapprobation of free unions felt
by the majority, even if the motives of these unions are the most noble. And this
also is why the more conservative a man is as to the institution of private property,
the more he holds to the existing form of marriage, a fact otherwise inexplicable.
</p>
<p>An examination of the modifications made during the last century in the matrimonial
law and in matters pertaining to it, shows that the position of the married woman
has improved gradually. To cite <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>only a few examples, the French civil code gave to the married woman the right of
divorce in the case of adultery on the part of her husband only if he kept a concubine
in the common dwelling (art. 230). In 1884 this article was modified so that the woman
now has the same right of divorce in case of adultery as the man. (Article 337 of
the penal code, however, punishes the adulterous wife by an imprisonment of from three
months to two years, while article 339 punishes the adulterous husband only if he
has been keeping a concubine in the common dwelling, and then only by a fine of from
one hundred to two thousand francs.) In England before 1870 the married woman was
in a position of dependence. The right of possession of personal property as well
as the administration of real estate and the benefit of revenues from it devolved
upon the husband. Since 1870 and 1882 there has been a great change in the matrimonial
law, to the great advantage of the woman who has become, among other things, the sole
owner of her fortune, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20682src" href="#xd31e20682">44</a> In the countries where there have been no modifications in the last century, public
opinion is such that we may be sure that the condition of women will be better in
case of an eventual revision of the matrimonial law.
</p>
<p>In searching for the causes of the changes of opinion upon this question we discover
that here again they are due in the last analysis to the economic life. This springs
from the fact that the number of women who work independently, who gain their own
bread, increases continually. The causes which bring this about are of diverse kinds
but can be reduced to the following. In the first place, the number of marriages contracted
is in general diminishing, and this decrease is due to the continually diminishing
number of marriages among the moneyed classes, and to the fact that these marriages
take place later in life than formerly.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20693src" href="#xd31e20693">45</a> It is not difficult to see that a retrograde movement in the marriages of the bourgeoisie
must tell. Marriage brings an increase of expenses indeed, but among the proletariat
it brings also an increase of revenue (the woman may earn something by working away
from home, or save by doing the work of the house herself). Among the bourgeoisie,
on the other hand, it brings with it pecuniary disadvantages only, at least if we
except those cases in which the wife is more or less rich. The struggle for existence
becomes <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>more and more difficult, and especially among the members of the petty bourgeoisie
and those who practice the liberal professions marriage does not take place until
later in life, and in general the number of marriages diminishes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20727src" href="#xd31e20727">46</a> To this it is still necessary to add the fact that in Europe and in some of the states
of North America the number of women exceeds that of the men.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20750src" href="#xd31e20750">47</a>
</p>
<p>The diminishing opportunity for women of the more or less well-to-do classes to marry
forces them to earn their own living. The change that housekeeping has undergone and
is still undergoing must also be taken into consideration. The importance of housekeeping
continually decreases in consequence of the extension of manufacturing, which absorbs
the special tasks of the household one after another. While formerly clothes were
made at home, bread was baked there, etc., at present there remains for the work of
the household only the care of the house and the preparation of the food. And even
these occupations may soon be taken out of the house.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20770src" href="#xd31e20770">48</a> Unmarried women of the bourgeoisie used formerly often to be able to find a home
with members of their family, since they were able to be of service. At present they
are in general only superfluous persons in the household.
</p>
<p>Even the married women of the bourgeoisie find themselves more and more forced to
contribute to the revenues of the family by working for money,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20801src" href="#xd31e20801">49</a> and this for reasons already cited in speaking of unmarried women: the increasing
difficulty of the struggle for existence, and the diminution of the importance of
household occupations. Outside of those whose economic situation forces them to work
for money, the number of women who seek to earn something is becoming greater and
greater. With these it is not necessity that forces them, but the spirit of independence
awakened in them by the example of the others. If, on the one hand, the supply of
women’s labor increases, on the other hand the demand is increasing also; for though
it has been asserted that women are incapable of anything beyond housekeeping, they
have proved their aptitude for many of the professions. And besides, the labor of
women is much sought after, for not being yet organized like men, the wages they can
obtain are not so large.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>And if the women of the bourgeoisie are engaging more and more in paid labor, the
women of the proletariat were forced into it long ago. The labor of women became possible
through the development of mechanical processes, as our exposition of the present
economic system has shown. Since then this form of labor has assumed larger and larger
proportions. The unmarried women of the proletariat are all obliged to provide for
their needs, while the married women also often are, and the number of these is continually
increasing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20811src" href="#xd31e20811">50</a>
</p>
<p>By what has gone before it has been indicated how important a change has taken place
and is still taking place in the economic position of women. This change is in the
last analysis the reason why women have revolted more and more against the inferior
position in which the law places them, and why their opposition has already taken
the form of deeds. This is the reason also why the legal position of woman is best
in general in those countries where she has freed herself most by her independent
work, as, for example, in the United States.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Up to this point we have examined only the legal side of the question. We must go
on to add some observations concerning the material side. The civil codes rest, among
other things, upon the fiction that all persons are equal. No mention is made of the
division into distinct classes; and it is the same with marriage. Before the law all
marriages are equal, while in reality they are not so. It is necessary, therefore
to treat of the conjugal conditions of the different classes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20824src" href="#xd31e20824">51</a>
</p>
<p>In the first place take marriage <i>in the bourgeois class</i>. The conditions of life for the two sexes are different before marriage. Leaving
out of account the fact that the number of women who provide for their own needs is
increasing (they are still in the minority), it is incontestable that the aspirations
of the women of the bourgeoisie tend toward marriage, the earliest and best marriage
possible, in order that their future may be assured. And since the possibility of
making a good marriage is becoming less, husband-hunting with all its unfortunate
consequences becomes more and more eager. While the whole education of women looks
only to marriage, that of the great majority of young men has as its object the attainment
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>wealth or an important position as soon as possible. Even when the marriage is contracted
in consequence of a reciprocal inclination, the differing conceptions of life held
by the two parties contain the germs that may render it unhappy. In speaking of these
very frequent cases Mme. Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd31e20872" title="Source: Adams-Lehman">Adams-Lehmann</span> very justly says: “Neither understands the other. Sundered in everything that belongs
to life, from childhood up, nature succeeds in uniting them at one point for a short
time only. From this point on their paths diverge. The husband complains often and
bitterly that his wife does not understand him. What would he have, when she belongs
to an entirely different civilization? She has her own virtues, her own failings and
vices, but they are not those of her husband, and serve principally to set her at
variance with him. And the same is true of the man, over whose lack of understanding
his wife just as often and bitterly laments. Different systems of culture, different
aims, different ideals,—in such an atmosphere how should harmony thrive?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20875src" href="#xd31e20875">52</a>
</p>
<p>But these causes are further strengthened when economic motives have influenced the
marriage more or less. If the two parties have frankly made their union on this basis
they will not be too exacting, and will know how to submit to the inevitable; but
when, as is ordinarily the case, the marriage has been contracted under false pretenses,
the situation is much worse.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20886src" href="#xd31e20886">53</a>
</p>
<p>It is plain, then, from this how little the legal form shows the reality. In order
that the marriage may be contracted, the consent of the two parties is necessary,
no matter how that consent is obtained. It is very often the parents who have made
the choice, being guided by calculation alone. Such is the reality, and the formal
<i>free</i> consent is only the appearance.
</p>
<p>Weighty causes, sprung from social conditions, then, often bring it about that the
married life is one of hate and discord. Aside from the reasons cited there is yet
another which does not proceed from social conditions. Even when the marriage has
been brought about through mutual inclination, there is no guarantee that this inclination
will last. Not only may the parties be deceived as to each other’s character and temperament,
but their feelings may change, and the marriage bond become insupportable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>The law permits divorce only in certain fixed cases; and since divorce brings with
it serious economic disadvantages for the woman, and sometimes for the man as well,
it is not often resorted to. The fear of losing the good opinion of one’s friends
may also prevent divorce. And this fear of blame where a divorce is desired proves
once more how little real love has to do with the origin of monogamy.
</p>
<p>If it is difficult, then, if not impossible, to break a marriage, the consequence
is bound to be adultery, especially on the side of the man, since his manner of life
gives him easy opportunity for it, and he does not fear the consequences as a woman
does. The difference between monogamy and the more ancient forms of marriage is not
great. Before the law monogamy alone is recognized and polygamy prohibited; but in
reality polygamy always exists.
</p>
<p>Let us go on now to marriage among <i>the proletarians</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20936src" href="#xd31e20936">54</a> Here there can be no question of a different education for the boy and the girl;
both are put to work while still children, and their relations are quite free. Among
the working classes marriage usually takes place at an early age, because the workman
early reaches the maximum of his earning capacity, and as a consequence it is useless
for him to wait long before marrying; besides which he reaches maturity sooner than
the bourgeois. Often marriage is contracted after it has been consummated and the
sexual intercourse has had results. This is easy to understand when one observes the
life of the proletariat, their housing conditions, their work in common, etc.
</p>
<p>While it is not true that the marriages of the proletariat are always marriages of
inclination, as has been asserted (for material interests play some part here also),
yet they are oftenest of this kind. One of the causes, then, which often make marriages
among the bourgeoisie unhappy does not exist here. On the other hand there are other
causes which can bring about the same result. In the first place, this inclination
is in many cases of a sexual nature only, without there being any sympathy of character.
If this inclination dies out, therefore,—a thing which happens very often, since marriages
in the proletariat are made at an early age, and the women soon grow old because of
their hard life—there is no longer any basis for a happy marriage. There is a lack
of that intellectual development which may render the difficulties of married life
supportable. In consequence of this lack the slightest differences may result in great
altercations, <span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>and the causes of unhappiness are sought in the person and not in the circumstances
of which the person is but the victim. Then in the next place there are the heavy
cares of the struggle for existence. If a laborer’s family have already enough difficulty
in making both ends meet, in the case of sickness or forced unemployment their misery
is extreme, and it is often this misery which causes disputes and even blows. Further,
the labor of women, the bad housing conditions, and alcoholism all tend to the same
result. And because of hard work and many cares the wife of the workman soon grows
old. In the proletarian class, therefore, marriages are threatened by many causes.
</p>
<p>There is besides all this a very important difference between the marriages of the
bourgeoisie and those of the proletariat as to their bases. The preponderating power
of the man, which is strongly marked in bourgeois marriages, is less so in the proletarian,
especially in those families where the woman provides for herself by paid labor. And
private property, one of the “<span lang="fr">raisons d’être</span>” of legal monogamy with the bourgeoisie, is lacking among the proletariat. This “<span lang="fr">raison d’être</span>” is found with the latter in the necessity that the man should be charged with providing
for the material needs of the children. Thus, in the proletariat the free union between
a man and a woman generally meets with disapprobation only when there are offspring.
The consequences are, first, that conjugal unions without legal sanction are not as
much frowned upon by the proletarians as by the other classes; second, that the decision
to dissolve the union, whether free or legal, is much more easily made among proletarians
than among the bourgeoisie.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20964src" href="#xd31e20964">55</a>
</p>
<p>With regard to marriage among the <i>lower proletariat</i> a word or two will suffice. Persons who have recently fallen to this class keep the
ideas of the class from which they came. But when the persons have been born in the
lower proletariat, or when their poverty has lasted for a long time, they become demoralized,
and the relations between men and women show the effects of it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20979src" href="#xd31e20979">56</a>
</p>
<p>We come, then, to the end of our exposition. It seems to me that it has been shown
that the different forms of marriage are in the last instance determined by the respective
modes of production. Hence the origin of monogamy, the most recent form of marriage,
is not to be found in the innate desire of the man and the woman to be united <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>for the whole of their lives, a desire which the law is supposed to sanction. Quite
on the contrary men are not all monogamous, and still less monogamous during the whole
of their life; a circumstance because of which the present economic conditions have
produced the legal marriage, obliging two persons to remain together; if it were otherwise
the law would not concern itself with the relations between man and woman.
</p>
<p>Some important modifications have taken and are taking place in this matter. The bases
upon which the present marriage system rests are changing. This is due to different
reasons. In the first place woman is coming little by little to occupy a higher and
more independent social position. Next, the importance of housekeeping in the economic
life is diminishing. The only moral basis for marriage is little by little coming
to be mutual love and sympathy, for true love can only exist between persons free
and equal.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e20994src" href="#xd31e20994">57</a> There is a constantly increasing number of persons who, in place of stigmatizing
as immoral a union that is non-legitimate, but contracted because of mutual love and
sympathy, consider it, on the contrary, as superior to a legal marriage contracted
for economic reasons.
</p>
<p>Finally, it is to be noted that the present economic and social life has bound up
the sexual life with the economic life, by making marriage possible only for those
who have the necessary means at their disposal, and consequently has caused the compulsory
celibacy of millions of men and women.

<p class="first">In the preceding pages we have fixed the attention principally upon the relation between
the man and the woman, and it now remains to treat of the position of the children
born of their union.
</p>
<p>It is a biological fact that the mother is designed by nature to have the care of
the child during its first years, and consequently this care persists through all
phases of the social development. It is, then, superfluous to speak of it in a sociological
treatise.
</p>
<p>The relations between parents and children have not always been the same in the different
phases of social development, and it is therefore impossible to speak here of relations
instituted by nature. A glance at the respective situations in the different periods
shows that among the “lower hunters”, where the woman is considered as the property
of the man, the children born are also in the absolute power <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>of their father, who has the right of life and death over his children, and whose
power over them ceases only when he has sold his daughters to their husbands, or when
his sons, having become adults, are recognized as members of the tribe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21014src" href="#xd31e21014">58</a>
</p>
<p>Among the upper hunters and the pastoral peoples it is, as with the peoples named
above, to the father, in general, that the children belong, or to whom they owe obedience.
The mother, herself in subjection to the father, has little or no authority over the
children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21026src" href="#xd31e21026">59</a>
</p>
<p>Among the lower agriculturists the conditions in question differ relatively very much.
As has been shown in the considerations upon marriage among these peoples, the position
of woman is often quite other than during the preceding periods. She is not at all
in so subordinate a situation, her position is even not without importance, thanks
to the place which she occupies in the economic life. And this importance shows itself
also in her relations with her children. In general it is to the mother that the education
of the children falls, while the influence of the father is little or nothing. In
these last cases a greater or less power belongs to the mother’s brother (under the
matriarchate the grandfather and father of the children belong to another clan, and
the maternal uncle and the children belong to the clan of the mother).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21035src" href="#xd31e21035">60</a>
</p>
<p>As has already been said above conditions among the higher agriculturists were patriarchal.
The father had unlimited power over his unmarried daughters, and over all his sons
with their descendants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21043src" href="#xd31e21043">61</a> It is from these so-called “great families”, that the present form of the family
springs (husband, wife, and their not yet emancipated children) as a consequence of
the fact that the adult sons have been able to emancipate themselves on account of
the modifications that the economic life has undergone. From this time especially
the affection for children in general which is found among almost all people, takes
on an exclusive character, and becomes limited to one’s own children. For monogamy
is before all a consequence of the desire of the man, which came in with private property,
to leave his possessions to the children of his legal wife, whose father he knew himself
to be.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21050src" href="#xd31e21050">62</a>
</p>
<p>In its essence this form of the family has been maintained down to the present day.
The modifications it has undergone may be reduced <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>to the two following.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21061src" href="#xd31e21061">63</a> In the first place, in consequence of her improved position as wife, the mother has
obtained a greater influence over the education of her children, though her power
is, under the law, still subordinated in every way to that of her husband. In the
second place the state manifests a continually increasing tendency to exert an influence
over the relations between parents and their children. To begin with, the state imposes
upon married parents the task of supporting and bringing up their children, and prohibits
by the penal law slaying or abandoning them. The origin of these requirements must
be found in the fact that the state is interested in having the children cared for,
in order that the population may be as numerous as possible. (The state being once
formed, while the causes of infanticide among primitive peoples have almost disappeared,
the law has no occasion to make any great change in the existing situation.) If the
married parents were not forced by the state to support and bring up their children<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21069src" href="#xd31e21069">64</a> it would be necessary to impose this task upon other institutions which do not exist
in our present society. The state is not an institution for the public well-being;
it is chiefly a means of maintaining the external order in the disorder which results
from the complicated and muddled system of capitalistic production; it is before all
a system of police. If it were otherwise, the state would consider it as one of its
first duties to deprive parents of their rights over their children, if they did not
perform their task, or did it badly, and would itself undertake the care and training
of these children, as well of those whose parents were dead or otherwise absolutely
unable to care for them. For society as a whole, as well as the children themselves,
has a very great interest in this matter.
</p>
<p>However, the state in general does not assume any duty towards abandoned or neglected
children, and only in a hesitating way intervenes to punish or to take away the parental
authority of those who have been guilty of such acts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21074src" href="#xd31e21074">65</a> Little by little, as the ideas upon the duties of the state become modified however
(principally under the influence of organized labor, which aims at transforming the
state into an organized community), it interests itself more in the person of the
child. As to the care of the child’s <i>property</i> all the codes are already very much detailed!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are two points with regard to which the state quite generally has an influence
over the lot of the child. First, it prohibits or limits his paid labor; and second,
it obliges parents to send their children to school.
</p>
<p>We have already spoken of this prohibition, which is made necessary from the fact
that the physical condition of the working classes is becoming worse, and because
the labor movement exercises a pressure upon the state. Compulsory education has its
origin, on one side, in the fact that, in some occupations, capitalism cannot make
use of workmen who are altogether ignorant; on the other side, in the fact that without
compulsory education the youth of the working class would be even more brutalized
than at present. The opposition to compulsory education on the part of whatever is
conservative is another clear indication of what an intimate connection there is between
the individual family and the present economic system. The economic position of the
man as breadwinner for his wife and children is the cause of his desire to be limited
in his power as little as possible.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Up to this point we have been treating of conditions past and present only in so far
as they are regulated by law (the formal side); we must now go on to treat conditions
from the material side. Here we must consider three subjects: physical education,
intellectual education, and moral education. In treating of criminality, however,
we have<span></span> naturally little to do with the first two, while the third is of the highest importance
for us.
</p>
<p>As to physical education it is enough to say that it is the “<span lang="la">conditio sine qua non</span>” of the two others. The intellectual and moral qualities of a child that is badly
cared for physically, can never be entirely developed. The parents (and the child
himself) use up all their energy in providing for their bodily necessities, so that
there is none left for the other needs. Dr. A. Baer says: “Children of this kind (<i>i.e.</i>, of the poor classes) already at an early age bear the cares and sorrows that life
imposes upon them; they early become acquainted with the claims and demands of life,
and not infrequently are very early influenced by living-conditions which will necessarily
affect them long afterward.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21101src" href="#xd31e21101">66</a>
</p>
<p>It is only among the bourgeoisie and the relatively well-to-do portion of the petty
bourgeoisie that there can be any sufficient physical education for the children.
Among the proletarians, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>those of the petty bourgeoisie who are in a similar situation as regards material
conditions, it is insufficient, and worse, if possible, among the lower proletariat.
However, if there is a lack of it among these last, there is at times a superabundance
among the bourgeoisie. There children are often brought up in such luxury that they
are early made blasé and rendered unhappy for the future. Dr. Baer says upon this
subject:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21111src" href="#xd31e21111">67</a> “It is through other circumstances and causes that the children of the rich and well-to-do
classes are brought to a condition of precocity, accompanied by sickly irritability
and arrogant self-conceit. Here are good-living, luxury, and the superabundance of
bodily enjoyments, the early familiarity with the theater, balls, and outside social
life in general, which make them incapable of the harmless pleasures of childhood.
Improper education in the family is responsible for the fact that children in widely
separated social classes are already at any early age left to themselves and fall
into evil ways. ‘One must have lived in a great city,’ says von Krafft-Ebing, ‘and
have visited the hovels of the poor, and the palaces of the rich to know what mistakes
in the bringing up of children are committed there, where the children of the poor,
amidst dirt and drink, and those of the rich, amidst arrogance and rascality, are
going to ruin physically and morally.… Every day may be seen children falling asleep
at the theater or other places of amusement to which their parents’ folly and desire
for pleasure have dragged them. Other parents provide for their children the doubtful
happiness of children’s balls and soirées. Is it any wonder, then, if we now, especially
in the great cities, very seldom meet with any real children?’ ”
</p>
<p>In the countries where education is compulsory, it is guaranteed that all the children
will acquire a certain amount of knowledge. It is unnecessary to say that in general
this amount of knowledge is very small in the case of the children of the poor, and
consists of the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic, so that there is no
real intellectual education. For the children of the bourgeoisie quite a different
preparation is made; here there is rather an over- than an undersupply of the means
of education. The great competition in present day society, the superabundance of
intellectual forces, the ardent desire to see their children succeed in spite of everything,
all this obliges parents to crowd their children’s intellectual capacities, even to
the detriment of their other qualities. “The thing which in our modern life conduces
most to the giving of a one-sided, inharmonious development to the child, is the fact
that too little weight <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>is given to the development of the disposition, and too much to the development of
the understanding. Because there is no influence exerted upon the spiritual and emotional
life, the mind of the child is often from early youth turned toward the material and
sensuous, the life of pleasure, and comes to bend its thought wholly to the practical
and utilitarian.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21119src" href="#xd31e21119">68</a>
</p>
<p>Thus we arrive at the very subject we have in view, moral education. As I have already
remarked, one of the characteristic differences between education among the primitive
peoples and that of our own day is this, that as a consequence of the great complexity
of our present society, and the numberless conflicts between individual interests,
the task imposed upon the educator is now much broader and more onerous.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21127src" href="#xd31e21127">69</a>
</p>
<p>The first condition, without doubt, that might be demanded of one who is to make a
child into a moral man, a man of character, is surely this, that he should be himself
a man of character. It goes without saying that no person can give more than he has.
Leaving aside for the moment the criminal class, of whom I shall treat later, it is
clear that no one without character, or weak in character, can ever train children
to have well developed moral sentiments. He may be able, it is true, to teach them
to distinguish good from bad, but such lessons concern only the intellectual part
of the nature and not the moral part, and they cannot transform children into persons
who <i>feel</i> morally. It cannot be denied that the number of persons who do not feel morally is
great, and that these have children. Without forgetting the fact that it is the father
to whom the law gives especially the parental authority, we must recognize that it
is the mother upon whom the task of education generally rests, because the father
is almost always away from home. But the inferior position of woman, maintained now
for centuries, has been extremely harmful to her character, and thus it often happens
that this lack of character passes to the children as well.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21144src" href="#xd31e21144">70</a>
</p>
<p>A second condition without which successful education is impossible is that educators
shall have the innate qualities necessary for their task. We should doubt, and not
without reason, the common sense of anyone who dared to assert that every person was
capable of becoming a good sculptor or even carpenter. Just so no one could say <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>that everyone possesses the qualities necessary for an art as difficult as that of
education.
</p>
<p>To be a good educator it is necessary to be very fond of children, to have much patience
and zeal, to know how to put one’s self on a plane with the child, to have a clear
and practical intellect, especially when the teacher has a great affection for the
child, since without intelligence the excess of affection will only be harmful. There
are parents who possess these qualities in a very high degree, and it is only to be
regretted that they teach only their own children, and not those also of parents in
whom the teaching faculty is entirely lacking. Next comes the group of those who have
a modicum of the requisite qualities, and finally a smaller group who have little
or no aptitude for the task. The least fit to give a good education, however, are
psychopathic individuals, because of their changeable disposition, their quick fits
of temper, etc.
</p>
<p>Just as educators differ greatly in their innate fitness for teaching, so different
children need to be guided in different ways. If there are children who require little
care in order that they may presently be able to adapt themselves to the requirements
of society, others, who form the great majority, require more; while there remains
a second minority who, if they are to be made fairly useful men and women, must have
constant and minute attention. Among these last are to be classed the victims of heredity.
If they have parents without great teaching ability, as is often the case with these
psychopathic individuals, the results are even worse.
</p>
<p>Aside from innate fitness it is necessary that an educator should have received the
necessary education. The teacher without notions of psychology, of pedagogy, etc.,
often deceives himself, even if he has all the necessary innate qualities, and consequently
warps the character of his pupils.
</p>
<p>The instructor must learn his trade, and if this is so, why should not the educator
in charge of the moral education of the child need an apprenticeship, since moral
education is a task no less difficult than intellectual education (which is about
all that our present schools undertake)? However, it is incontestable that in all
classes of society today moral education is practiced in dilettante fashion, as was
formerly the case with intellectual education.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21160src" href="#xd31e21160">71</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, there remains the condition that the teacher should have the time necessary
to perform his task, for without this the most <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>capable cannot attain good results. Having now laid down the general conditions, let
us go on to examine in a few words education as it is actually practiced in the different
classes.
</p>
<p>Let us begin with the bourgeoisie. As has already been remarked, the children in this
class are often spoiled by the great luxury that surrounds them, and further by the
fact that their intellect is developed at the expense of their moral qualities. As
my remarks concerning capacity, character, etc., apply to all classes, it is unnecessary
here to speak of them more fully. Only it must be observed that, as far as positive
knowledge of pedagogy is concerned, the bourgeoisie is much superior to the proletariat,
from which there follows among other things a corresponding superiority of the bourgeois
education. The character of the bourgeois woman, who occupies, like all women, a lower
rank in society, has generally suffered still more from her easy mode of life, and
her weakness of character is transmitted to her children if she brings them up herself.
This condition must be added, for society life, or in other words, the habit of doing
nothing at all, is often the cause of mothers’ having their children brought up by
some one who has neither natural aptitude nor acquired capacity for this task, but
only takes charge of the children for the sake of a place. There are even children
who are not suckled by their mothers but by nurses, since the mothers are afraid of
diminishing their own charms. This proves once more the weakness of the allegation
that the parents are the natural educators of the child; for we see in this case that
the social environment can lead to the renunciation of duties that are really natural.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21180src" href="#xd31e21180">72</a>
</p>
<p>The moral education of the children of the bourgeoisie is generally superficial, and
has especially in view the task of teaching the children to conduct themselves according
to the proprieties, much more than that of developing their real moral nature.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21188src" href="#xd31e21188">73</a> In the second place this education develops among them a very strong feeling of class,
so that they consider the members of the proletariat as inferior beings, born by nature
to serve the bourgeoisie, in place of seeing in them only their own fellows, who have
become different merely because of fortuitous circumstances.
</p>
<p>In the third place, our present educational system makes children egoistic, those
of the bourgeoisie more than those of the proletariat. This assertion contradicts,
it is true, the numerous authors who are convinced that our present education in the
family is a source of <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>altruism.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21199src" href="#xd31e21199">74</a> They are right when they say that altruistic sentiments <i>between the members of the family themselves</i> have their rise <i>within</i> the circle of the family. For a long time the life within the family constituted
a man’s whole life (as it still does for a very great number of women), but in the
society of today a great part of the time is passed outside of the family circle,
and for this reason the opinion of these authors, though shared by many persons, is
not correct. In the family circle the child, especially when he has neither brothers
nor sisters,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21211src" href="#xd31e21211">75</a> soon discovers that his own interests come first, that the outside world is his enemy,
and that when he grows up he must make himself as large a place there as possible.
It matters little that the interests of others will then be injured. It must be added
further, that if on the one side the family is an economic unity, and that the interests
of the members of the family are so far parallel, on the other hand there exist opposing
interests, such as inheritance, which may destroy the homogeneity of interest.
</p>
<p>It may be objected here that in our present society, consisting as it does for the
most part of adherents of Christianity, most children are taught to love their neighbor
as themselves. This is true, but in a society such as ours, where the interests of
all men are opposed, the effect of this commandment cannot be great, or will be practiced
only in words and not in acts, and so end in hypocrisy. He who wants to follow this
commandment to the letter sees himself at once defeated in the conflict of life, unless
he changes his opinion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21216src" href="#xd31e21216">76</a>
</p>
<p>No one known to me has better characterized the existing educational system than Owen.
“As society is now constituted,” he says, “no children can by possibility be really
well educated. The fundamental errors upon which it has been based, filling the early
mind with error and hypocrisy and all manner of conflicting ideas, opposed to facts
and to nature, render it impracticable for any child to be rationally trained or treated
by society. And the more education of this kind is given to children, the more they
are estranged from a knowledge of themselves, or of human nature generally, and the
less competent will they be to understand what society has been made to be, and yet
less what it ought to be, and how it may be made what it is desirable that it should
be, for the happiness and well-being of all.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Mothers and fathers thus taught, are incompetent to teach and educate their children
in the spirit, manner, and conduct, which should, for the benefit of all, be given
to all children. Their affections also, especially the strong natural animal affections
of the mother, are, in almost all cases too strong for the very limited powers of
judging accurately respecting their own children and those of other parents, which
females now acquire from their present mal-education.
</p>
<p>“The individual family arrangements confining the child to the limited number of ideas
among them—to their early deep impressions in favor of family interests and supposed
rights—to the narrow and partial experience of a family and its usual small connections,
are equally destructive of a good sound practical education or well-training of children.
</p>
<p>“The individual system of society which has so long prevailed in all nations, and
amongst all peoples, is also a strong barrier to the proper education of beings intended
to be made rational. The individual system of society is injurious to man now, under
every point of view in which it can be considered; but especially in the education
of children of all classes. It confines all their strongest feelings to self first,
then to family, afterwards to kindred, and then to small neighborhoods and districts,
regularly and systematically training each child to become at maturity a merely localized,
ignorantly selfish animal, filled with family and geographical prejudices.
</p>
<p>“As long as this individual system shall be continued, it will be vain to expect that
any child can be well educated, or properly trained to become a rational being—a man
with the full physical and mental powers of humanity, intelligent, moral, and virtuous.
The isolated character formed by the individual system will, as long as children shall
be educated under it, and in accordance with all its innumerable errors in practice
and principle, render it impossible for any child to be so educated and placed in
society as not to become, more or less, a cause of anxiety to its parents. Every child
under this system comes into society, at its birth, opposed by the capital and experience
of society; and as it advances in its progress, and has to take part in the jostle,
bustle and business of life, it has to contend for itself, often, not only against
these general powers of society, but on the death of parents, or sometimes even before,
with brothers and sisters, for individual property or other advantages.
</p>
<p>“Besides, children before they have any resisting powers of mind, being forced to
receive the errors of their parents and other early instructors, respecting their
supposed faculties of believing and disbelieving, <span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>loving and hating, are by this process, placed through life in direct opposition to
nature; and, as vice has been made, by the gross errors of our ancestors, to consist
in acting in accordance with nature, and virtue in acting in opposition to it, and
as nature continually impels the individual to desire to act in accordance with its
own laws, in defiance of man’s unwise and unjust laws, the great probability is that
children will be more liable to obey nature than man; and thus, where there are children,
they must be a source of constant anxiety to parents; and that anxiety must be injurious
to the best formation of the organization of the remainder of the infants that may
be born to them.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21235src" href="#xd31e21235">77</a>
</p>
<p>We have still to fix our attention upon the sexual education of the children of the
bourgeoisie. In our society the Christian sexual ethics is dominant, often even among
non-Christians, without their being conscious of it. According to this system the
whole sexual life proceeds from the evil one, and man would be better without any
sexual instincts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21241src" href="#xd31e21241">78</a> This is why children are generally raised in an absolute ignorance upon this subject,
or even have lies told to them about it. As nature cannot be suppressed it follows
that the curiosity of the child only becomes the more inflamed, and that the conduct
of men in this regard becomes hypocritical.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21251src" href="#xd31e21251">79</a>
</p>
<p>Secondly, let us take up education in the petty bourgeoisie. Upon this point we can
be very brief. A part of this class joins on to the proletariat from the conditions
of its life, and another part to the bourgeoisie. It is unnecessary, therefore, to
speak of it at length. It is only the core of the petty bourgeoisie who, having kept
the traditions of their class, show any differences in this regard. Here there is
no danger of the demoralizing influence of the luxurious surroundings of the rich,
and the surveillance of the father is greater, and thus the education more severe;
but the limited conception of life, and the continual efforts of the parents, eager
to procure advantages for their families, develop egotism among their children in
a high degree.
</p>
<p>With regard to the proletariat it has already been shown that the material advantages
necessary for a sufficient education are lacking in the case of this class. Housing
conditions are here of the greatest importance. Generally there is not room enough
for the children at home, so that they spend the greater part of the day in the street.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>Then again the housing conditions are responsible for the fact that the children often
are thrown with persons whose influence is harmful to them (prostitutes, etc.). And
finally the small apartments bring it about that the children are too early instructed
in sexual matters, and this in a bad way (through sleeping in the same small room
with their parents, or in the same bed with children of the opposite sex, etc.).
</p>
<p>Then children need to grow up in an environment not poisoned by cares, one in which
poverty does not harden the heart, and extinguish all gayety, and where the knowledge
necessary for education is not wanting. Further, in this class the father has generally
no opportunity to busy himself with the education of his children in consequence of
the long duration of his hours of labor outside of the home. A great many working
men have to leave home in the morning to go to work long before their children are
awake, to return only after the little ones have already been put to bed; and the
situation is much the same where the laborer works at night, and consequently sleeps
during the day.
</p>
<p>The development of capitalism has led to the paid labor of married women, and consequently
to one of the most important causes of the demoralization of the children of the working
class. When there is no one to watch a child, when he is left to himself, he becomes
demoralized. In his work, “The Condition of the Working-Class in England”, F. Engels
has put the situation briefly: “The employment of the wife [in the factory] dissolves
the family utterly and of necessity, and this dissolution, in our present society,
which is based upon the family, brings the most demoralizing consequences, both for
parents and for the children. A mother who has no time to trouble herself about her
child, to perform the most ordinary loving services for it during the first year,
who scarcely indeed sees it, can be no real mother to the child, must inevitably grow
indifferent to it, and treat it unlovingly, like a stranger. The children who grow
up under such conditions are entirely ruined for later family life, can never feel
at home in the family which they themselves found, because they have always been accustomed
to isolation, and they contribute therefore to the already general undermining of
the family in the working class.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21266src" href="#xd31e21266">80</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>Finally, when, through death or otherwise, the parents are no longer in a position
to support and raise their children, they are left to their fate, unless there are
charitable persons or benevolent institutions that wish to take charge of them. For
the state, for reasons shown above, does not lay upon itself the duty of caring for
such children.
</p>
<p>It remains now to speak of the lower proletariat, among whom prostitutes and criminals
are included. The education of these persons is not only much neglected, as is often
the case with the children of the proletariat, of whom it may be said that they receive
a negative education—but these receive in addition a positive education in evil. It
might be possible to dispute the advantages of a good education, but it is indisputable
that children brought up by immoral people, or even incited to evil (prostitution
or crime) run the greatest risk, unless exceptional circumstances present themselves,
of becoming persons hurtful to society.
</p>
<p>In this connection it is necessary to fix our attention, finally, upon the situation
in which illegitimate children find themselves. Since marriage, at once the consequence
and support of existing social conditions, is the only form of sexual union legally
recognized, illegitimate children are legally and socially treated as pariahs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21310src" href="#xd31e21310">81</a>
</p>
<p>It is difficult to form an idea of the great number of children who, in our present
society, are neglected or abandoned. The following passage may help form some conception
of it: “If the reader will imagine a procession of 109,000 children marching past
him, and notice attentively child after child as it goes by, he will get some idea
of the extent of the suffering of children with which the ‘National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children in England’ has actually had to do during the first
ten years of its existence.
</p>
<p>“The first 25,437 are sufferers from injuries inflicted upon them with boots, crockery,
pans, shovels, straps, ropes, pokers, fire, boiling water, in short with every imaginable
instrument that came to the hand of the brutal and vindictive parents—covered with
wounds and bruises, burned, scalded, and covered with plasters and bandages.
</p>
<p>“Then come 62,887 sufferers from neglect and starvation—covered with dirt, eruptions,
and sores, trembling, in rags, half-naked, pale, weak, faint, feeble, pining, starving,
dying—many of them borne in the arms of the nurses of the hospitals.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Then come 712 funeral processions, where the maltreatment ended fatally.
</p>
<p>“Then come 12,663 little beings, their sufferings displayed to turn the lazy and cruel
benevolence of the street to those who are answerable for their pallor, leanness,
and coughs—most of these, too, are still in arms, but in the arms of vile drunkards
and vagabonds.
</p>
<p>“Then come 4460 pitiable girls, victims of the lust of human monsters.
</p>
<p>“Then come 3205 little slaves of unsuitable and harmful occupations and dangerous
performances, untimely births in traveling vans, acrobats at fairs, trapeze performers
and tight-rope walkers in circuses, laboring under too heavy a load, and suffering
the most diverse outrages. The procession is 60 miles long and takes 24 hours to pass
by.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21348src" href="#xd31e21348">82</a>
</p>
<p>The society spoken of above is a private institution. The extent of its labors is
very limited, which is why it has not taken cognizance of a great number of the children
who have been thus treated. At the time when the report containing the above figures
had just appeared, it had only been in operation ten years—during the last five more
effectively, as a part of the first five was taken up with the organization of its
service. Finally the field of its labors includes only the United Kingdom, while capitalism
reigns over a great part of the world and has everywhere the same consequences. In
consideration of these facts we can form an idea of the great destitution in which
a multitude of children are found, and what sort of persons children so treated are
likely to grow up to be.
</p>
<p>To sum up what has been said, we see that the system of education for the child has
not always been what it is now, and that we cannot therefore speak in this connection
of institutions created by nature, except as regards the relation between mother and
child during the first years of the latter’s life. It has been shown, I think, that
the present system of education is closely bound up with the method of production
of the day. No one can deny that in this regard also we are far from living in the
“best of possible worlds.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21384src" href="#xd31e21384">83</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By prostitution must be understood the social fact that there are women who sell their
bodies for the exercise of sexual acts, and make a profession of it. The putting of
one’s body at the disposal of another for the purpose of sexual intercourse constitutes
then at times the sale of merchandise. To find the cause of prostitution in our present
society it is necessary to begin by asking: “What are the causes for the demand for
this merchandise?” These causes may be reduced to the following:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> The difficulty or impossibility of marrying found by many men. We have already seen
that in our present society there is a continually increasing number of the petty
bourgeois and of those who practice the liberal professions who, in consequence of
the insufficiency of their incomes, cannot marry, or only at a rather advanced age.
As we have seen, also, this is not in general the case with the proletariat. They
reach the maximum of their wages while still quite young, and are less exacting as
regards their material needs. All this brings it about that they marry sooner and
so have less recourse to prostitution. (Soldiers and seamen, who are often forced
to remain unmarried, form an exception.)
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Besides those of whom I have been speaking, those also must be mentioned who do not
wish to attach themselves for life to a single woman. Further, separate education,
inducing a different life for the two sexes, is often an obstacle to the easy meeting
of two persons <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>who might make a marriage of inclination. Many men renounce marriage because the intellectual
plane of women is altogether different from theirs, as a consequence both of their
education and of their manner of life, and also because with them the thought of improving
their economic position by marriage predominates.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21538src" href="#xd31e21538">85</a>
</p>
<p>The larger contingent of men who have recourse to prostitutes is made up of bachelors,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21552src" href="#xd31e21552">86</a> and the smaller of married men. Whence springs the following cause:
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Often the marriage is not contracted from inclination, but for financial reasons,
which brings it about that the men often indemnify themselves with prostitutes. But
this is applicable also to those cases where the marriage has not been made for the
reasons named, but in which, for any cause, an antipathy has sprung up between the
couple, without the dissolution of the marriage, either because of the difficulty
of securing a divorce, or from motives of expediency. Since monogamy does not proceed
from an innate inclination, prostitution is a necessary correlative of marriage.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> The keeping of extravagant mistresses is a pastime for those who have been demoralized
by a life of luxury and ease, and at the same time is a means by which these people
can get rid of their incomes.
</p>
<p><i>e.</i> Finally, prostitution is a means whereby rich perverts satisfy their inclinations.
</p>
<p>Before leaving the causes of the demand for prostitutes there is one further matter
to consider. Those who have recourse to prostitutes must necessarily have a low opinion
of woman, whom they consider only as an object existing for pleasure, and thus bound
to be ready, as soon as a man wishes, to furnish him what he desires, for money, and
not because of affection. This vile fashion of regarding women has been universal
for centuries, and is still pretty general. It is to be explained from the long-continued
inferior social position of women. We have seen that this position has been improved
little by little, and that the result of this improvement has been an increase in
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>number of men who have a higher opinion of woman, and who wish to have sexual relations
with a woman only when there is a mutual affection between them. These persons form
even today only a small minority, however.
</p>
<p>In the presence of a majority still thinking quite differently it is absurd to preach
total sexual abstinence to all unmarried young men, as certain moralists do (Tolstoi,
for example). Though there are men who abstain without injury to their health, these
moralists forget that the satisfaction of the sexual desires is one of the most important
needs of the majority of men (the life of our day certainly increases these desires),
and that present social conditions are the cause of men’s considering woman their
inferior. Dr. Blaschko, in his work “<span lang="de">Die Prostitution im XIX Jahrhundert</span>”, rightly says: “The sexual requirement in the case of mankind as of all other beings
is an entirely natural one. To be sure, it is not so strong and compelling as the
necessity of food and drink; it can be suppressed in the case of anyone for a time,
and with many permanently, without injury to the health. But what is true of this
or that person does not hold for the mass of mankind, for whom sexual intercourse
is doubtless a necessity.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21573src" href="#xd31e21573">87</a>
</p>
<p>It is now necessary to inquire why there is a sufficient supply to meet this demand.
Before beginning, however, one remark must be made. The point of departure of the
etiology of prostitution must be the incontestable fact that modesty is not an innate
but an acquired quality. The problem is chiefly, then, what are the causes why the
feeling of modesty is not sufficiently developed among certain women. The following
are the principal causes:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Immoral environment. We shall examine this first in so far as it affects children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21601src" href="#xd31e21601">88</a> In running over the statistics which mention the age of prostitutes one is particularly
struck by the fact that a great number of them are still very young. To cite some
examples: Dr. G. Richelot gives the following figures in his work “<span lang="fr">La Prostitution en Angleterre</span>”:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e21621src" href="#xd31e21621">89</a>

<p>As these figures show, there is a considerable portion of the prostitutes who are
minors, but they do not tell us of the number of adults who embraced the profession
while they were yet under age. As to this point, Dr. Bonhoeffer gives the following,
showing the age at which the prostitutes whom he examined began the practice of their
profession:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e22426src" href="#xd31e22426">97</a>

<p>A large majority of prostitutes, then, have been placed upon the registers of the
police while still under age. We may very well say, moreover, without fear of mistake,
that a great part of those who are registered at a later period of life have already
been among the clandestine prostitutes. Dr. Augagneur says: “How many of these women,
devoted indefinitely to the life of a common prostitute, would not have fled all its
horrors if a society, careless of the interests of its members, had furnished them
with sufficient means of defense up to the age at which they all have succumbed,—under
21 years? <i>When a woman has not prostituted herself before 21, she will not prostitute herself
later.</i> Look for exceptions to this rule and you will find that they are very few. The woman
who is older and more experienced knows the consequences of her acts; less passionate,
less weak, and less impressionable, she resists better a first temptation whose consequences
she is fully aware of.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e22698src" href="#xd31e22698">100</a>
</p>
<p>However this may be, it is certain that a very great proportion of the prostitutes
have taken up their profession, or have been seduced, while they were still very young.
Upon this latter point the following figures enlighten us:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e22704src" href="#xd31e22704">101</a>

<p>The facts already brought out give rise to the presumption that the ranks of prostitutes
are in a very large measure recruited from the less well-to-do classes, where the
neglect of children has assumed enormous proportions, and not from the more favored
classes where the children are carefully guarded and kept away from unfavorable influences.
The correctness of this conclusion is shown by a further examination. According to
figures given in the “Reports” quoted above, only 44 out of 3,076 prostitutes, or
1.4%, came from the well-to-do <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>classes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e22909src" href="#xd31e22909">103</a> In his “<span lang="de">Sozialpolitisches Handbuch</span>” Dr. Lux publishes the following table:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e22915src" href="#xd31e22915">104</a>

<p>As the table given above shows, the Russian prostitutes are recruited in greater numbers
from the bourgeoisie than in the other countries of Europe. The Russian bourgeoisie,
however, cannot be compared with that of other countries. It is more like the petty
bourgeoisie, as the following quotation given by Dr. Fiaux proves: “The committee
considers that the great mass of the women registered belong to the lower classes.”
The fact that, of 100 prostitutes, 83 come from poor families, 16 from well-to-do
families, and one from a rich family, proves the same thing.
</p>
<p>After having given the professions of 3,332 fathers of prostitutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23147src" href="#xd31e23147">107</a> Parent-Duchatelet arrives at the following conclusion: … “prostitutes born in Paris
all proceed from the artisan class, and … it is not true, as some persons have assured
me, that there are to be found among them a number belonging to very distinguished
families; …”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23151src" href="#xd31e23151">108</a>
</p>
<p>In speaking of the prostitutes born outside of Paris he says: “… there is a mass of
facts more than sufficient to prove to us that, as far as the class of society from
which prostitutes come is concerned, the departments do not differ in any way from
Paris; we see upon the last table as upon the first, only working people and those
little favored by fortune, who consequently cannot take care of the education of their
daughters, nor watch them, and still less provide for their needs when they have reached
a certain age, …”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23157src" href="#xd31e23157">109</a>
</p>
<p>We must particularize these unfavorable environmental influences. And the first fact
that we meet is that a part of the young prostitutes have been incited to the profession
by their parents. Parent-Duchatelet mentions 16 cases in which mother and daughter
were both registered prostitutes<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23163src" href="#xd31e23163">110</a>; and von Oettingen quotes the following from Dr. Tait:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23167src" href="#xd31e23167">111</a>

<p>In the second place it is necessary to speak of the abandonment of the children of
the poor classes. No scientist of consequence admits that the moral ideas are innate,
but simply that the new-born infant is more or less fitted to appropriate such ideas.
It follows that one cannot expect much from a child whose moral education has been
neglected in youth, however great natural capacity he may have been endowed with.
From this it follows that where there is lack of education and care because of the
death of the mother, or the alcoholism of the father, or because the father and mother
are both at work away from home a great part of the day, or where the morality of
the parents themselves is not great, the children run great risk of being lost. The
following figures support this assertion:
</p>
<p>Von Oettingen shows that, according to Dr. Ryan, 12,000 to 14,000 prostitutes in London
became such as a consequence of a neglected childhood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23323src" href="#xd31e23323">112</a> In the “Reports of the Select Committee,” etc., the following figures are found:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23327src" href="#xd31e23327">113</a> of 3,075 prostitutes 1,481 (48%) were orphans, and 921 (29%) were half-orphans. In
his “<span lang="fr">La prostitution clandestine à Paris</span>”, Dr. Commenge gives the following figures concerning the 2,368 prostitutes whom
he observed during the years from 1878 to 1887:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23333src" href="#xd31e23333">114</a>

<p>Out of a total of 190 cases Dr. Bonhoeffer shows 72 (38%) in which the education had
been positively bad (criminality or prostitution on the part of the parents, neglect,
lack of surveillance, etc.); 106 cases (56%) in which the education had been probably
bad; and only 12 cases (6%) in which it was proved that the education had been good.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23365src" href="#xd31e23365">115</a>
</p>
<p>For Russia Dr. Fiaux gives the following figures:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23371src" href="#xd31e23371">116</a> 3.6% of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>prostitutes still had father and mother; 47.5% had parents who were separated, and
18.5% were without any family.
</p>
<p>With regard to the cause given for prostitution Dr. Augagneur says as follows: “The
majority of prostitutes are born to prostitution at the same time that they are to
puberty. Their moral sense, if such may be called that which no one has ever tried
to awaken, is not shocked by their situation; they have prostituted themselves without
shame and without regret. They have left normal and respectable society without being
really aware of its existence, without the desire of ever returning thither. They
have lacked the things necessary to make them respectable women—instruction in virtue,
the example of their relatives, the suspicious surveillance of their mothers, and
material well-being. The daughters of the people are not, at the day of their birth,
of a clay inferior to that of the daughters of the bourgeoisie or of the nobility;
they are naturally no less intelligent, no more perverse. And yet if you examine the
civil status of a hundred prostitutes, you will find that 95 at least have sprung
from the lowest strata of society. The existing social inequality, that is to say,
is alone responsible for this unequal distribution.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23379src" href="#xd31e23379">117</a>
</p>
<p>Finally I will cite once more the opinion of Parent-Duchatelet, which is of great
value, since this author is the most able sociologist who has treated of this subject.
He says: “The misconduct of parents, and the bad examples of every kind which they
give to their children, must be considered with regard to many girls, and especially
those of Paris, as one of the causes determining their mode of life. The dossiers
of each girl constantly make mention of disorder in the household, of fathers who
are widowers living with concubines, of lovers of mothers widowed or married, of fathers
and mothers separated, etc. What surveillance can such parents exercise over their
children, and if they judge it proper to give a reprimand, or give good advice, what
authority could such observations have in their mouths?
</p>
<p>“Thus the depravity, the indifference, the necessitous position of many people of
the last class provoke, or do not or cannot prevent, the corruption of the children;
we may say in general with regard to a good number of prostitutes, what observation
continually teaches us of criminals, that they have for the most part an ignoble origin.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23386src" href="#xd31e23386">118</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb334a">[<a href="#pb334a">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the third place, we must name as a cause of the demoralization in youth bad housing
conditions. One of the most pronounced characteristics of the child is his propensity
to imitate. Hence it follows that the fact that a whole family must live and sleep
in one or two rooms has the most harmful consequences for the sexual morality of the
children. Sexual life has no longer any secrets for the child of the poor classes
at an age at which this life is still a thing unknown to the children of the well-to-do
classes.
</p>
<p>I will give here some figures to show how small the dwellings of this class are. According
to an investigation made in Berlin in 1895 there were 4,718 dwellings without fireplaces,
and occupied by 13,700 persons; more than 200,000 dwellings consisted of a single
room with a fireplace, and 22,160 of these were occupied by more than 6 persons. There
was the following percentage of “overcrowding” (in official statistics this means
more than 6 persons in one room with fireplace, and more than 8 persons in two rooms
with fireplace, or in one room with kitchen attached): in Königsberg 10.6; in Halle
10.3; in Breslau 9.9; in Lübeck 8.75; in Görlitz 6.91; in Leipzig 7.85; in Altona
7.62; in Munich, 4.41; in Kiel 4.46; in Mannheim 11.8. In 1890 there were living in
overcrowded dwellings the following number of persons to the 1,000: in Berlin 784;
in Munich 533; in Breslau 754.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23430src" href="#xd31e23430">119</a>
</p>
<p>According to the investigation made in 1890 there were in Vienna 23,921 dwellings
consisting of a single room, with 64,621 occupants, and 103,433 dwellings of two rooms,
with 411,314 occupants. These two groups include 44% of the dwellings and 35% of the
population. Professor von Philippovich, in the article from which these data have
been taken, shows that in the districts inhabited by the Viennese <span class="corr" id="xd31e23439" title="Source: workingmen">working-men</span>, Ottakring, Meidling, and Favoriten, 29.3%, 30.8%, and 31.26% respectively of the
dwellings of one or two rooms were “overcrowded” (<i>i.e.</i> 3 to 5 persons in a room).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23444src" href="#xd31e23444">120</a>
</p>
<p>The 1899 census of the Netherlands gave the following results: There were 307,937
dwellings consisting of one inhabited room each, and occupied by 1,172,014 persons
(22.7% of the population); and there were 334,355 dwellings consisting of two rooms
each (including <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>kitchens, alcoves, and covered passages), occupied by 1,497,353 persons (29% of the
population).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23457src" href="#xd31e23457">121</a>
</p>
<p>The detailed statement shows the situation still better. There were 45,641 dwellings
of only one room, with 4 persons in each; 62,548 dwellings of more than one room with
5 or 6 persons; 41,877 dwellings of only one room, occupied by 6 or more persons;
45,363 dwellings of 2 rooms which were occupied by 3 or 4 persons; 20,582 dwellings
of two rooms with from 4 to 6; and 706 dwellings of two rooms with 6 occupants or
more.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23466src" href="#xd31e23466">122</a>
</p>
<p>What is often lacking besides is space to place a sufficient number of beds, or even
the means of procuring them. In a great number of cases children of different sexes
must sleep together in one bed, or even with adults. It also often happens that the
inhabitants of these already insufficient dwellings are obliged to take night-lodgers.
There are the following percentages of dwellings with lodgers: in Leipzig, 17.5; in
Breslau, 12.5; and in Berlin, 15.8.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23472src" href="#xd31e23472">123</a> In Vienna 6.4% of the population are night-lodgers, and in Berlin 6.1%<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23478src" href="#xd31e23478">124</a>.
</p>
<p>It goes without saying that among these persons lodging together there are some who
are demoralized and dangerous to children. In his work, “<span lang="de">Verbrechen und Prostitution</span>”, P. Hirsch depicts these dangers as follows: “Think in how narrow a space an entire
family is penned up together, so that at times a separation of the sexes is scarcely
possible, at a time when the sexual instinct of the growing children is already beginning
to develop. The children unhappily only too often are present at the most intimate
occurrences and early lose all feeling of shame. How can decency and good morals be
learned by children whose parents are obliged to take prostitutes as lodgers? Who
shall protect these unfortunates from moral contamination? Often a word will be spoken
in their presence, or an occurrence take place, which they are not yet, perhaps, able
to understand. But the childish nature is receptive to such impressions, and what
happens in their presence falls upon fruitful soil, and what has remained fixed in
their memory from earliest youth, will, if later their sensuality is once aroused,
bear terrible fruit. We are astonished when we hear a twelve or thirteen year old
girl use language which we are accustomed to hear only from prostitutes who have followed
their trade for years; we are astonished at the sophistication of persons still quite
young, and are inclined at once to pass an unfavorable judgment <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>upon them. Truly our judgment would be quite different, we should have sympathy with
them, and should be made to reflect, if we came to know the holes in which these poor
creatures passed their childhood.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23491src" href="#xd31e23491">125</a>
</p>
<p>As a cause of the demoralization of young girls we must note, finally, child labor.
In the first place there are children who are sent to sell flowers, matches, etc.,
and this causes them to be neglected and to frequent bad company. With regard to this
Hirsch says: “One has only to get into conversation with the children who sell flowers,
matches, and the like on the streets of the great cities in the evening, or to overhear
their talk, to be astonished at their sophistication. One would hardly believe with
what shamelessness such boys speak of sexual matters with growing girls in the same
situation, without blushing and quite as a matter of course, since they have been
accustomed to it from earliest childhood. It is no wonder that from these circles
a considerable contingent is furnished to the ranks of prostitution and crime.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23552src" href="#xd31e23552">126</a>
</p>
<p>A second cause is work in factories, by which girls are brought into contact with
adults who, from their often coarse manners and language, and their lack of moral
sentiments, corrupt these children for their whole lives. After having spoken of the
other dangers which threaten the morality of children, Lecour says: “If she has escaped
these dangers the child, placed too young as an apprentice, will meet other perils.
There will be the contact with girls who are older and already corrupted, and workmen
who respect neither youth nor innocence, who boast of debauchery, propagate immorality,
and dishonor the daughters of their comrades. There will be, perhaps, the impure domination
of the proprietor or foreman.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23566src" href="#xd31e23566">127</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us now look at the influences which demoralize adult women. In the first place
we must speak of the influence of profession. The following figures serve to show
which are the professions from which prostitutes are recruited most:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e23599src" href="#xd31e23599">128</a>

<p>These statistics show that a quite considerable number of the prostitutes have been
workwomen in factories. (In Russia manufacturing is very little developed—hence the
low figures there.) We may accept it as indisputable that this labor has in general
very disadvantageous consequences for the morality of the workwomen.
</p>
<p>In his work, “The Condition of the Working Class in England”, Engels depicts these
consequences in the following terms: “The collecting of persons of both sexes and
all ages in a single workroom, <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>the inevitable contact, the crowding into a small space of people to whom neither
mental nor moral education has been given, is not calculated for the favorable development
of the female character. The manufacturer, if he pays any attention to the matter
at all, can interfere only when something scandalous actually occurs; the permanent,
less conspicuous influence of persons of dissolute character, upon the more moral,
and especially upon the younger ones, he cannot ascertain and consequently cannot
prevent. The language used in the workshops was characterized by many witnesses in
the report of 1833 as ‘indecent’, ‘bad’, ‘filthy’, etc. (Cowell, evid., pp. 35, 37,
and in many other places). It is the same process upon a small scale which we have
already witnessed upon a great one in the great cities. The centralization of population
has the same influence upon the same persons, whether it affects them in a great city
or in a small factory. The smaller the mill, the closer the packing, and the more
unavoidable the contact; and the consequences are not wanting. A witness in Leicester
says that he would rather let his daughter beg than have her go into a factory; that
they are perfect gates of hell; that most of the prostitutes of the town had the mills
to thank for their present condition (Power, evid., p. 8). Another in Manchester ‘did
not hesitate to assert that three-fourths of the young factory employees of from 14
to 20 years of age were unchaste’ (Cowell, evid.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> p. 57). Commissioner Cowell expresses it as his opinion, that the morality of the
factory operatives is somewhat below the average of the working class in general (p.
82). And Dr. Hawkins says (Rept. p. 4), ‘An estimate of sexual morality cannot readily
be reduced to figures, but if I may trust my own observations and the general opinion
of those with whom I have spoken, as well as the whole tenor of the testimony furnished
me, the aspect of the influence of factory life upon the morality of the youthful
female population is most depressing.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24111src" href="#xd31e24111">135</a>
</p>
<p>And then it happens at times that the proprietors or their foremen by abusing their
power force the working-girls who please them to yield to their desires. Engels says
of this: “It is a matter of course that factory-servitude, like any other, and to
an even greater degree, confers the ‘<span lang="la">jus primæ noctis</span>’ upon the master. In this respect also the employer is sovereign over the persons
and charms of his employees. The threat of dismissal suffices to overcome all resistance
<span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>in nine cases out of ten, if not in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, in girls who,
in any case have no strong inducements to chastity. If the master is mean enough,
and the official report mentions several such cases, his mill is also his harem; and
the fact that not all manufacturers use their power, does not in the least change
the position of the girls. In the beginning of the manufacturing industry, when most
of the employers were upstarts without education or consideration for the social hypocrisy,
they let nothing interfere with the exercise of their vested rights.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24147src" href="#xd31e24147">136</a>
</p>
<p>Besides factory workers domestics form a very considerable percentage of the prostitutes.
As the Berlin statistics cited above show the percentage of workers has diminished
and that of domestics has increased. According to Dr. Blaschko the cause of the diminution
of the percentage of factory workers is to be found not only in the fact that, the
year 1898 being very prosperous, poverty did not come in as an important factor in
the same measure as formerly, but also in the raising of the intellectual and moral
plane of the Berlin working-women. It is impossible to speak of a similar raising
of the plane of the domestics. The nature of their occupations prevents their forming
associations; they are therefore deprived of the moral effect of the trades union.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24197src" href="#xd31e24197">137</a> The causes of the importance of the contingent furnished to prostitution by the domestics
are of different kinds. Besides the reason I have just mentioned, the fact is to be
noted that it is not from among the most intelligent and best of the working classes
that domestic servants are ordinarily drawn. For these prefer the less dependent position
of working-woman to that of domestic. In the second place there is the influence of
the occupation itself. (There are still others, of which I shall speak later.)
</p>
<p>It is easy to understand how the occupation of domestic has a demoralizing influence.
Not only do young girls, often ignorant and without education, come to live in surroundings
of a sort to pervert them, but there is also their dependence upon people who only
demand that their work shall be well done, the lack of civilizing influences, <span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>and the isolation that deprives them of contact with their fellows, all of which lowers
their moral plane.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24207src" href="#xd31e24207">138</a>
</p>
<p>Aside from the two groups cited there are still other occupations which may exercise
a demoralizing influence, such as that of barmaid, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24239src" href="#xd31e24239">139</a>
</p>
<p>Before closing our observations upon demoralizing environment as a cause of prostitution,
we must fix our attention upon the evil influences to which many women are exposed,
those, that is, who must provide for their own needs and do not live at home. The
smallness of their wages does not permit them to rent a room by themselves but they
are obliged to content themselves with a bed simply. This brings at once great moral
disadvantages. But further, this arrangement drives the persons in question into the
street when not at work, since often the landlords do not allow them in the house
except during the night. The harmful consequences of this are sufficiently obvious.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24275src" href="#xd31e24275">140</a>

<p><i>b.</i> The maternity of girls and concubinage are among the causes of prostitution. Parent-Duchatelet

<p>The statistics cited show, then, that the cause named occupies a quite considerable
place in the etiology of prostitution. This cause is entirely a consequence of the
existing social conditions, which maintain the dependent position of woman, and of
marriage, which brings it about that every woman living with a man as with a husband
is despised, even when the union is due to inclination, and that life is made very
hard for her, especially if a child is born of the union. However, it must be added,
that this applies especially to the women of the middle classes, and that “free love”
and the child that is the fruit of it, are not at all so despised among the proletariat,
for, as we have seen above, the bases of the present legal monogamy have not so great
an importance there.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24392src" href="#xd31e24392">144</a>
</p>
<p>However this cause of prostitution only makes itself felt when the woman to whom it
applies is also deprived of all pecuniary means. And so we come to the third category
in the etiology of prostitution.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Poverty. As the statistics already cited have shown, almost all prostitutes spring
from the classes without fortune, and the great majority of them have been at first
working-women or domestics, and consequently have belonged to families without fortune.
If such women, for any reason whatever, cannot find work, they are thrown into poverty.
As this happens constantly in society, poor women find themselves forced into prostitution.
The facts are there to prove it. In treating of the etiology of prostitution Parent-Duchatelet
gives the following figures:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24428src" href="#xd31e24428">145</a>

<p>The author says among other things: “Poverty, often pushed to the most frightful extreme,
is still one of the most active causes of prostitution. How many girls abandoned by
their families, without parents, without friends, unable to find refuge anywhere,
are obliged to have recourse to prostitution in order not to die of hunger! One of
these unfortunates, still susceptible to feelings of honor, strove to the last extremity
before taking up a part which she regarded as extreme, and when she came to register
herself it was shown that she had not eaten anything for three days.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24473src" href="#xd31e24473">146</a>
</p>
<p>“One would hardly believe that the career of prostitution has been embraced by certain
women as a means of fulfilling their duty as daughter or mother; yet nothing is more
true. It is not unusual to see married women who have lost their husbands or been
deserted by them, become prostitutes with the sole purpose of not leaving a numerous
family to die of hunger. It is still more common to find young girls who, not earning
by their labor enough to provide for the wants of their aged and infirm parents, ply
the trade of prostitute in the evening to make up what is lacking. I have found the
marks peculiar to these two classes of prostitutes too often not to be convinced that
they are more numerous in Paris than one would believe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24479src" href="#xd31e24479">147</a>

<p>Dr. Blaschko shows that the forced idleness among garment makers during some months
of each year causes an increase of prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24556src" href="#xd31e24556">150</a>
</p>
<p>As we have seen in the first part of this work, it has been proved at various times
that crime against property increases or diminishes according as the economic situation
is favorable or unfavorable. If poverty is one of the causes of prostitution it must
follow that the number of prostitutes will vary at the same times as the general condition.
Statistics prove that this is what does actually happen. However, we need only take
into consideration the figures for registered prostitutes; if we had at our disposal
the figures for clandestine prostitution they would naturally show still greater modifications.

<p>Leaving aside the abnormal years, 1870 and 1871, we perceive that the prosperous years
1872 and 1873 give very low figures. After this period times become worse and worse,
while the number of prostitutes sustains a considerable increase. From the year 1882
economic conditions began to improve, and the figures for prostitution correspondingly
fell, to rise again very noticeably during the unfavorable years 1889 to 1892.
</p>
<p>In his work “<span lang="de">Statistik der gerichtlichen Polizei im Königreiche Bayern und in einigen anderen Ländern</span>”, Dr. Mayr also gives convincing proofs of the parallelism between the changes in
the economic situation and prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24790src" href="#xd31e24790">152</a>
</p>
<p>However it is not only forced unemployment leading to great poverty that is one of
the causes of prostitution; we must also consider as such the fact that the wages
paid to women are often so small that it is <span class="corr" id="xd31e24815" title="Source: imposible">impossible</span> for them to pay even their necessary expenses, and are thus obliged to find some
supplementary source of income.
</p>
<p>In his work already quoted, “<span lang="de">Die wirthschaftlichen Ursachen der Prostitution</span>”, Pappritz fixes the minimum that a working woman in Berlin must have for her strictly
necessary expenses at 600 marks a year. Most of the women working in factories generally
earn but 500 marks. The average earnings in 1897 were 457 for dressmakers, and 354
for those who made the button-holes (hand labor). And yet the wages paid in Berlin
were not the lowest—the average for all Germany was 322 marks.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24824src" href="#xd31e24824">153</a>
</p>
<p>It will not be very difficult to quote several authors who, in treating of this subject
as regards Germany, have expressed themselves in the same way. But I must be brief,
and hence shall content myself with citing a passage from Dr. Frankenstein’s “<span lang="de">Die Lage der Arbeiterinnen in den deutschen <span class="corr" id="xd31e24831" title="Source: Groszstädten">Grossstädten</span></span>”, in which he sums up the result of his studies upon this subject<span class="corr" id="xd31e24834" title="Source: ;">:</span> “A very great proportion of the working-women of our great cities receive wages that
are not sufficient to provide the most indispensable necessities of life, and find
themselves for this cause in the dilemma either of seeking a supplementary trade in
prostitution, or of falling into the unavoidable consequences of bodily and spiritual
destruction.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24837src" href="#xd31e24837">154</a>
</p>
<p>It is evident that the same thing is true of all the countries where capitalism reigns.
Here is what Faucher, for example, says in his <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>“<span lang="fr">Études sur <span class="corr" id="xd31e24857" title="Source: l’angleterre">l’Angleterre</span></span>”: “Work with the needle is so poorly paid in London that the young persons who give
themselves up to it earn only three or four shillings a week, working sixteen or eighteen
hours a day. The wages of a fancy needle worker, for a hard day, are from 50 to 60
centimes, while linen workers generally get 30 centimes for stitching a shirt. Nothing
more frightful could be imagined than the existence of these poor girls. They must
get up at four or five o’clock in the morning, at all seasons of the year, to go to
work, or to receive the orders of the merchants. They work without relaxation until
midnight in small rooms, where they are crowded together by fives and sixes for economy
in the use of fuel and light. If they are admitted to a dressmaker’s or linen draper’s
establishment, they are ill-fed, and under pretext of pressure of business are kept
at their task day and night, with only four or five hours of sleep, which are further
regularly limited on Saturday. This sedentary life and constant confinement ages them
before their time, when phthisis spares them. Is it to be wondered at if some, frightened
and disheartened at finding the way of virtue so hard, hold out their arms to prostitution?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24860src" href="#xd31e24860">155</a>
</p>
<p>Against these long, hard days and small wages are to be set the easy life and often
quite considerable returns—at least in the beginning of their career—which prostitutes
enjoy. Moreau-Christophe in his “<span lang="fr">Du Problème de la Misère</span>” says that in London there are prostitutes who earn $100 to $150 a week, and that
the average earnings are $10 a week.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24868src" href="#xd31e24868">156</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>To conclude I wish to call attention to the opinion of Parent-Duchatelet concerning
this state of things in Paris. He says: “Of all the causes of prostitution, particularly
in Paris, and probably in the other large cities, there is none more active than the
lack of work, and the poverty inevitably consequent upon insufficient wages. What
do our dressmakers, seamstresses, menders, and in general all those who work with
the needle, earn? If we compare the wages of the most capable of them with what those
of only moderate abilities can make, we shall see that it is not possible for these
last to procure the mere necessaries of life. And if we then compare the price of
their labor with that of their dishonor we shall not be surprised that so great a
number fall into a life of shame made all but inevitable.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e24875src" href="#xd31e24875">157</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb347a">[<a href="#pb347a">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not only does poverty, taken in the sense of the lack of the actual necessaries of
life, act as a cause of prostitution, but also that relative poverty which prevents
women from enjoying luxuries which seem necessities, like jewelry and fine clothes.
With these same women laziness also plays a part.
</p>
<p>Now the general opinion with regard to these factors is that they belong exclusively
to the individual nature, that they are innate to some women, and that they consequently
have nothing to do with the social environment. In my opinion this is entirely erroneous.
Mankind are born with certain needs. The non-satisfaction of these needs causes death
or the wasting away of the organism. These needs are what we call the strict necessities.
All the other wants are awakened by the environment: that is to say, each possesses
them in germ, but they are latent as long as the surroundings do not develop them.
For example, no one would suffer from abstaining from tobacco if he did not see someone
smoking; no woman would want expensive clothes if others did not wear them; etc. The
desire to dress expensively, to wear jewelry, etc., is not at all, then, an individual
quality of certain working-women; the germ of this want is innate in each individual,
without any exception though in different degrees. The present order of society, by
permitting certain women to spend immense sums for senseless luxury, awakens in others
the desire to imitate them as far as possible. Since these last have not the means
necessary to shine, they seek them where they may find them, and as there is only
the way of prostitution, many follow it. We may add to this that a great number of
men use their money and their distinguished manners to decide those who hesitate.
This is, therefore, also one of the reasons why the ranks of prostitution are so often
recruited from among dressmakers and domestics, <i>i.e.</i> from among those who come into direct contact with the luxury of <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25023src" href="#xd31e25023">158</a> Another cause which makes women desire expensive and useless things is their low
degree of culture, which shows them nothing more preferable than the possession of
luxury. And where women who have all the leisure and the means necessary to busy themselves
with more serious matters set the example of frivolity, we ought not to be surprised
that those without the same advantages try to follow their example.
</p>
<p>The same is true of idleness. If each person who is capable of it would do a certain
amount of work, any normal individual would be ashamed to pass the day doing nothing.
But the fact that there are women who are esteemed though they remain idle, awakens
in other women, who are obliged to work long and hard, the desire to do nothing also.
As prostitution opens to them the means of remaining unoccupied, they have recourse
to it to satisfy their desire.
</p>
<p>The irony which comes out so often in the social life shows itself here; the rich
women who despise prostitutes never suspect that they themselves are in part the cause
of the fall of the others, and that placed in the same poor surroundings they themselves
would not act differently.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25040src" href="#xd31e25040">159</a>
</p>
<p>All those who rank the causes last cited among individual factors base their opinion
upon the thesis, equally strange and false, that there are two kinds of persons: those
who by birth are destined to command and to enjoy, and those who are destined only
to obey, to work, and not to enjoy at all. Looked at from this point of view the person
who rejects these conditions constitutes an individual anomaly.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be objected that without admitting the existence of individual causes
it will be impossible to explain why, though a great number of women live under the
conditions named, only a small fraction prostitute themselves. Those who reason in
this way commit the error already spoken of, of thinking circumstances the same when
they really differ. There are no two persons who live under <i>exactly</i> the same conditions, how much less thousands. To give one example only: all the women
who earn only the strict necessities of life have not been raised in the same environment.
Those who have grown up in favorable surroundings have perhaps so great an aversion
to prostitution that they prefer a life of poverty to one of abundance procured by
prostitution. It is possible that these women <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>would prefer suicide to selling themselves, if they came to a state of complete destitution.
Secondly it is necessary that a woman should not be too ugly, or the possibility of
her earning her living by prostitution is excluded. No one would claim, however, that
feminine beauty is one of the causes of prostitution; placed in another environment
a woman would not prostitute herself simply because of her beauty.
</p>
<p>Although the reasons already given refute in great measure the supposed objection,
it must be confessed that the question is not thus entirely answered. Just as all
the beings of a certain species differ among themselves, so these women differ naturally
as to their innate qualities. The one will have more decided and more numerous wants
than the other, she will be less laborious, more frivolous, etc. (qualities which
in themselves have nothing to do with prostitution), and, other things being equal,
she will be more exposed to the temptation to become a prostitute. All this is perfectly
true, but it has nothing to do with the etiology of a social phenomenon like prostitution.
For we are here in the presence of two distinct problems; why, of two persons placed
in the same situation (supposing that to be possible), the one is more in danger of
becoming a prostitute than the other; and, second, what are the causes of the social
phenomenon which is called prostitution? The answer to the first question must be
that in part at least it is because people differ as to the intensity of their characteristics
and of their appetites. The answer to the second is the social conditions.
</p>
<p>When two persons of different height are fording a river, and the shorter steps into
a hole and is drowned, should we have the right to say that the difference between
the height of persons is one of the reasons why people are drowned? I think not. The
only reason why there are people who are drowned is that a man cannot live in water—which
in no way excludes the fact that a short person runs more danger of drowning than
a tall one.
</p>
<p>Now as to prostitution—the atmosphere in which certain women live is the cause of
their fall, which does not prevent its being true that some of them run more risk
than others. The truth of this assertion may be proved by an observation of the facts.
Among women who are not prostitutes also there are more who are lazy, frivolous, etc.
than those who are not. And though the former have not prostituted themselves, if
they had lived in bad surroundings and in poverty they would have run more risk than
the latter. If all women were exactly equal prostitution would be as general as it
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>now; only in this case it would be in every case the environment which would decide
what woman became a prostitute, whereas in reality there are, alongside of the environment,
individual differences which determine which ones run more risk than the others.
</p>
<p>Those who believe that there are here individual causes at work always take the point
of view that society is not an organism but a collection of individuals, and that
consequently an examination of the individual will suffice to explain social phenomena.
It is by the study of prostitution, for example, as a social phenomenon that we bring
out the fact that individual differences do not play any part in the etiology of prostitution.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Among the causes of prostitution must not be forgotten the fact that many persons
have pecuniary interests in it. Without this many women would never have become prostitutes
or would not have remained such, and the opportunity for a man to procure the services
of a prostitute would not be so good. Capital has settled down on this as upon every
place from which profits are to be drawn. The profession of the keeper of a house
of ill-fame being extremely lucrative, great sums have been invested in it. In order
to furnish the necessary material for these capitalists an international commerce
has been created, whose ramifications extend over almost the whole world, and in which
large sums are employed, the “white-slave trade.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25064src" href="#xd31e25064">160</a> Often before their entrance into these houses the prostitutes have already plied
their trade, but many innocent girls become the dupes of the false promises of these
traffickers and are given over to the keepers of houses of prostitution. In his “<span lang="de">Der Mädchenhandel</span>” Dr. Hatzig says: “The girls, in so far as they do not give themselves up voluntarily
as objects of traffic, are generally enticed with illusory promises of a glittering
future.… Advantageous positions in foreign countries are as a rule offered to them,
while nothing is said of the unchaste object of the business. To this especially is
to be ascribed the enormous exportation of Hungarian girls into Russia, to whom engagements
as dancers in St. Petersburg are promised. When the unhappy victims have once arrived
at their destination they would hardly venture to escape from the hands of the slave-trader.
In helpless case, deprived of the protection <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>of friends and country, they submit to their fate and are sold to houses of prostitution.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25122src" href="#xd31e25122">161</a>
</p>
<p>Once fallen into the hands of the keeper of such an establishment it is almost impossible
for these women to free themselves. He holds them in all sorts of ways. For example,
he will exchange their clothes for others not proper to wear in the street, and will
charge them so high a price that they are in his debt; often they do not understand
the language of the country; etc. Legally slavery is abolished, but in reality it
always exists for these women.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25127src" href="#xd31e25127">162</a>
</p>
<p><i>e.</i> The ignorance of a part of the women, a consequence of the environment in which they
were brought up, is also one of the causes of prostitution, and no inconsiderable
one. Dr. Richelot gives the following figures:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25171src" href="#xd31e25171">163</a>

<p>From an examination of the statistics given it is evident that the number of illiterates
is very large, however they may be decreasing in number now that primary education
for the children of the poorer classes is becoming more and more general. Knowing
how to read and write, however, proves very little as to the culture of the individual.
The statistics only show the number of prostitutes who are totally illiterate, and
we must certainly count many of the others as well among the ignorant.
</p>
<p>It is clear that ignorance alone does not lead to prostitution. But it is clear that
many prostitutes would not have become such, or would not have lent an ear to the
flattering offers of good positions, etc., if they had known what an abominable life
awaited them.
</p>
<p>Among the secondary causes of prostitution must certainly also be classed:
</p>
<p><i>f.</i> Alcoholism. Not only have many women been seduced when they had drunk too much, and
so have become prostitutes, but the demoralization which is the result of the constant
abuse of alcohol may have the same effect.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25386src" href="#xd31e25386">167</a>
</p>
<p><i>g.</i> Degeneracy. According to some physicians (among whom <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>are Professors Lombroso and Tarnowsky, to cite only the most famous) the cause of
prostitution is not to be found first in the environment, but in a pathological (or
atavistic) condition. These authors have examined a certain number of prostitutes,
and have drawn from this examination the conclusion that the stigmata of degeneracy
often found in them indicate a state which is the cause of their misconduct; prostitution
is in large part kept up by born prostitutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25405src" href="#xd31e25405">168</a>
</p>
<p>There is one objection to be made to such a manner of proceeding, namely that we must
in the very beginning give a precise definition of the social phenomenon which is
called prostitution. This definition, which can perhaps be given only by the sociologist
and not by the biologist, will show us at the outset that it is very difficult to
represent anyone as born with a tendency to commit sexual acts <i>for economic reasons</i>. So Professor Lombroso understands a totally different thing by prostitution from
what it really is. He says: “Sometimes in the beginning marriage does not even exist
and prostitution is the general rule”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25417src" href="#xd31e25417">169</a> and as an example he cites that the Naïrs live in complete promiscuity. According
to Professor Lombroso, then, everywhere that there is no marriage there is prostitution.
In other words, according to him all nature is one grand brothel, in which, aside
from the married women, all the females would be prostitutes! Truly Professor Lombroso
has some sociological views all his own.
</p>
<p>These authors claim, then, that prostitutes often present stigmata of degeneracy.
An examination of the figures shows, however, that 63% of all the prostitutes examined
show almost no such stigmata.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25428src" href="#xd31e25428">170</a>
</p>
<p>For 63% of them then degeneracy cannot be the cause, nor does it follow that it is
the cause in the remaining 37% of cases. For many women with these stigmata are not
found at all among the ranks of prostitution. To bring out the real import of the
researches in question we must put beside them the results of an examination of non-prostitutes.
It is for this reason that I wish to call attention to the work of Dr. P. Näcke, “<span lang="de">Verbrechen und Wahnsinn beim Weibe</span>”, in which the author arrives at the result that only 3% of the normal women examined
by him failed to show signs of degeneracy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25437src" href="#xd31e25437">171</a> It seems to me, then, that when we find figures so low among normal women the thesis
of Professor Lombroso is not proved.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span></p>
<p>If his conclusion were true, prostitutes would be drawn from all classes of society,
for degeneracy is present in all classes. But, as we have seen above, they are drawn
almost exclusively from the poorer classes. Professor Lombroso thinks he has refuted
this argument (which is enough to overthrow his whole theory) by saying: “The woman
who, coming from the lower classes, ends by becoming the inmate of a brothel, in the
upper classes becomes an incorrigible adultress.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25443src" href="#xd31e25443">172</a> Consequently according to Lombroso there is no difference between a prostitute and
an adultress. It is not necessary to combat such singular ideas: they refute themselves.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless the theory named is not without importance for the problem of prostitution.
The following quotation, taken from a recent study of Dr. Bonhoeffer shows what its
importance is: “We have no more right to speak of prostitution as inborn than we should
have to speak of a born drinker. The disposition brought about through the defective
psychical condition is inborn. But whether a psychically defective female individual
will become a prostitute is in a certain sense dependent upon chance and external
conditions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25450src" href="#xd31e25450">173</a>
</p>
<p>There are persons who are born with psychic defects. These persons adapt themselves
to their environment only with difficulty, and have a smaller chance than others to
succeed in our present society, where the fundamental principle is the warfare of
all against all. Hence they are more likely to seek for means that others do not employ
(prostitution, for example). If the defect of a woman has relation especially to the
sexual sphere, so that she feels, for example, extraordinary sexual desires, the danger
of her becoming a prostitute is very great.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25456src" href="#xd31e25456">174</a> Even when the environment in which such persons live is very favorable, it is nevertheless
certain that their actions will be different from those of others, though it does
not at all follow that they will infallibly become prostitutes. It is certain that
these morbid cases are rare in general, and very rare among prostitutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25481src" href="#xd31e25481">175</a> Parent-Duchatelet says: “Finally there are girls who give themselves up to prostitution
in consequence of a licentiousness which one can explain only by the action of a mental
disease …; but in general these Messalinas are rare; I have only found one opinion
upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>this fact, and it has been abundantly confirmed by my own researches.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25489src" href="#xd31e25489">176</a>
</p>
<p>This theory, that the principal cause of prostitution is to be found in innate psychic
defectiveness, contains, as Dr. Blaschko says (in his “<span lang="de">Die Prostitution im XIX Jahrhundert</span>”), “a small grain of truth in a mass of exaggerations.” It is only a very small proportion
of prostitutes who have gone into the profession for this reason, and it is certain
that they would not have done so if circumstances had not contributed to bring it
about.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25498src" href="#xd31e25498">177</a>
</p>
<p>We have now arrived at the end of our observations upon prostitution. In our opinion
it has been shown that it is partly the inevitable complement of the existing legal
monogamy, and partly the result of the bad conditions under which many young girls
grow up, the consequence of the physical and mental misery in which the women of the
proletariat live, and the consequence also of the inferior position of woman in our
present society. When we make exception of a few cases where a certain degeneracy
enters in beside the effect of the unfavorable environment, the prostitution of today
is, then, the consequence of existing social conditions, which, in their turn, spring
from the economic system of our time.
</p>
<p>It may be objected that prostitution has presented itself under other economic systems.
I am not ignorant of this, but I know also that 3 × 4 = 12, and 2 × 6 = 12 also; that
is to say that two different causes may produce the same result. The prostitution
of our day may be the consequence of capitalism while that of earlier periods may
have been the consequence of the mode of production of those times. Further, an examination
of the epochs in which prostitution was a general phenomenon (it never reached proportions
as great as under capitalism)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25537src" href="#xd31e25537">178</a> shows us that they did not differ much from our own in those matters which concern
the question in hand, namely, the inferior position of woman, and the strong contrasts
in fortunes.
</p>
<p>Many authors who have taken up the question of prostitution declare that it is as
old as humanity itself. If we understand by prostitution what it really is, and not
what imagination makes it out to be, this assertion is absolutely false. Prostitution
is of very ancient <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>date, but it has not always existed. Westermarck, one of the authors best qualified
to pronounce an opinion upon this matter, says: “Prostitution is rare among peoples
living in a state of nature and unaffected by foreign influence. It is contrary to
a woman’s natural feelings as involving a suppression of individual inclinations.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25549src" href="#xd31e25549">179</a> I advise those who, in spite of everything, wish still to maintain that prostitution
belongs to all time and all places, to investigate the peoples among whom the matriarchate
exists. If they are so unfamiliar with sociology, let them look for prostitution in
the country. They will find none; prostitution exists only in the cities.

<h3 class="main">ALCOHOLISM.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25558src" href="#xd31e25558">180</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We understand by alcoholism the social phenomenon which consists of the chronic abuse
of alcoholic beverages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25592src" href="#xd31e25592">181</a> Before touching upon the etiology of this phenomenon we must decide the biological
question, why does a man consume alcohol? Always and everywhere it has been established
that the liking for narcotics is natural to man. Those who believe that human nature
is inclined to evil, and that the tendency to excess is innate, find the solution
of the problem very simple. They reason as follows: “by alcohol this innate desire
is satisfied; man is inclined to excess,—ergo … alcoholism.” Those who deny the evil
nature of man find here on the contrary the crux of the problem. For, say they, the
facts are there to prove that man has not always and everywhere been intemperate;
there must then be other causes than this so-called sinful instinct.
</p>
<p>Alcoholic beverages are consumed first, because they are agreeable to the taste (at
least some of them); second, and especially, because aside from the taste they have
the power of awaking agreeable sensations. In his work “<span lang="de">Der Alkoholismus</span>” Dr. A. Grotjahn expresses himself thus upon this point: “Narcotics act … not primarily
through their agreeable taste, but influence directly the cerebral cortex and awaken
pleasurable sensations which are completely independent of the activity of the senses
or of pleasure-producing perceptions of the outer world. There is no other means of
producing pleasurable sensations independent of the perceptions <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>arising from the outer world, and independent of the functions of the senses. Only
in this way is it to be explained that the need for the use of narcotics has attained
so wide a dissemination, and struck such deep roots when once mankind had learned
their use.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25607src" href="#xd31e25607">182</a>
</p>
<p>If alcohol is used regularly, then, to drive away disagreeable sensations, the consumption
must necessarily increase if the individual wishes to attain the same psychical condition,
for use continually weakens the effect.
</p>
<p>Here, as in the case of the etiology of other social phenomena, we must treat the
different causes of alcoholism separately, although it often happens that a number
combine to make a man alcoholic. We shall begin with the causes which lead to alcoholism
among the proletariat, for it is in this class that the abuse of alcohol is most widespread
and produces the greatest ravages, first because the quality of the drinks consumed
is very bad, and secondly, because alcohol has more harmful effects upon a badly nourished
system.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> There are occupations which, by their nature, lead the workmen who follow them almost
inevitably to the abuse of alcohol. Dr. Grotjahn says: “The mental condition suffers
when the temperature is too high or too low, more than the capacity for work. The
great discomfort while at work may be removed by regulating the things which influence
the temperature (clothing, housing, heating, ventilation) or the uncomfortable feelings
may be blunted through copious draughts of spirituous beverages. Hence the peculiar
custom of taking alcohol against great heat and great cold both, a thing which would
be absurd if alcohol worked specifically against the one extreme of temperature or
the other, and did not simply moderate the unpleasant sensations produced by abnormal
temperatures.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25615src" href="#xd31e25615">183</a>
</p>
<p>In the second place come the industries in which much powder or gas are produced.
To quote Dr. Grotjahn again: “The dust, which those working in the open air have at
times to endure, but which those who work in closed rooms must almost always put up
with, brings about, through directly irritating the mucous membrane of the mouth,
a highly annoying thirst, which greatly induces the drinking of beer and brandy. We
hear it on all sides from workmen who outside of working hours are entirely moderate
or even abstemious, that the thirst which is excited by dust is not nearly so well
quenched by water or any ‘soft drink’ as by the use of alcoholic beverages. Experience
shows that in the callings which are dust-producing there is a marked tendency to
beer- and brandy-drinking, and to a quick passage from <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>moderate to immoderate use of alcohol. This is the case with masons, carpenters, cabinet-makers,
but especially with grinders and quarry-men. The production of irritating vapors in
chemical works has a similar effect, but more intense than that of ordinary dust.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25623src" href="#xd31e25623">184</a>
</p>
<p>In the third place there are the industries in which the workmen are brought into
direct contact with alcohol. Thus there are, for example, the workmen in distilleries,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25629src" href="#xd31e25629">185</a> breweries, alcohol-warehouses, etc.; then wine tasters, those who have to use alcohol
in their business, and finally those whose business takes them into establishments
where alcoholic drinks are sold, such as commercial travelers, and the tenants of
the establishments themselves.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25643src" href="#xd31e25643">186</a>
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The too great length of the working-day. Workers who are forced to work much longer
than the human organism can stand are inclined to the abuse of alcohol for two reasons.
In the first place they find in it the means of repairing temporarily the diminution
of force caused by great fatigue. Since alcohol gives only a temporary increase of
capacity, its continued use, and consequently its abuse, is therefore almost inevitable.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25653src" href="#xd31e25653">187</a> This is the cause of the great development of alcoholism among longshoremen, who
often work for twenty-four hours or even longer at a stretch.
</p>
<p>In the second place immoderately prolonged labor produces a veritable torture, which
can be assuaged by large quantities of alcohol. Those who have an interest in having
the workman toil as long as possible have always tried to prevent the shortening of
the working-day by claiming that it would increase the abuse of alcohol. The facts
have shown, however, that just the contrary is true. It has been proved that it is
not the shortening of the working-day, but its too great extension that is one of
the important causes of the abuse of alcohol. So it is not by chance that the retailers
of alcoholic beverages are among the most zealous opponents of the shortening of the
day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25661src" href="#xd31e25661">188</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>c.</i> Bad and insufficient nourishment. There are many workers not sufficiently nourished
for the support of the body. For the purpose of removing the feeling of discomfort
arising from this they make great use of alcoholic drinks. In these cases the nourishment
is insufficient both objectively (considered from a physiological point of view) and
subjectively (it does not satisfy the individual). Besides these there are those who
are able to procure a sufficient quality of food but lack the means to vary the dishes
and to replace foods that are bulky and difficult to digest (potatoes, bread, cereals,
etc.) by others less bulky but more nutritious (especially meat). The persons who
rely upon persuasion in combating alcoholism, fix the attention upon the enormous
sums expended for spirituous drinks, and then figure how much bread, how many beds,
and other useful things could have been bought with this money. All this is well and
good, only in reasoning in this way they make the capital error of representing a
workman as a sort of machine who says to himself: “I do not earn enough for the support
of my family—let us not buy alcohol, then, for it is harmful but rather eat more potatoes.
It is true that the discomfort will persist, but … I shall at least be nourished as
well as <i>possible</i>.” However, since the working-man is, no more than other men, a being who is content
to reason, but who feels, the calculations of these Utopists fall to the ground.
</p>
<p>Aside from the bad quality and insufficient quantity of the food, very often the working
family do not know how to give an agreeable taste to the dishes they eat; and in families
where the married woman herself is employed away from home they often have to content
themselves with cold viands. In these cases spirituous drinks serve to counteract
the discomfort of the monotony and bulkiness of the food. Among a number of proofs
which may be brought in support of what has been said above, we may cite the researches
made by a Swiss inspector of factories, M. Schuler, upon the relation between alcoholism
and the food of the working-classes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25722src" href="#xd31e25722">189</a> In this investigation the following facts appear.
</p>
<p>In the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, and <span class="corr" id="xd31e25731" title="Source: Neufchatel">Neufchâtel</span> the condition of the people with regard to food is the best; a small consumption
of potatoes and a large consumption of meat. Little brandy is drunk there, the use
of alcohol being mainly limited to a large consumption of wine. The workmen in the
canton of <span class="corr" id="xd31e25734" title="Source: Neufchatel">Neufchâtel</span>, except those employed in watch-making, live in poor circumstances, eat many potatoes
and also drink much brandy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the cantons of Berne and Lucerne the living conditions of the working class, and
especially their food, are very bad; they consume much grain and little meat, and
in these districts they drink an extraordinary quantity of brandy. In Aargau there
is a great difference between the condition of the industrial proletariat and that
of the proletariat engaged in agriculture. The food of the former is insufficient,
potatoes forming the main resource; furthermore the working day is very long, and
the consumption of brandy is correspondingly great. The food of the agricultural laborers,
on the other hand, is much better (a greater consumption of meat and of milk) and
the consumption of brandy is much less than among the factory hands. In the canton
of <span class="corr" id="xd31e25740" title="Source: Zurich">Zürich</span> the conditions are much the same as those in Aargau.
</p>
<p>All this shows clearly that it is the bad material condition of the proletariat which
causes alcoholism, for everywhere that the condition of the industrial worker is raised
above that of the agricultural population (as, for example, among the skilled workmen
at Winterthur), the consumption of brandy is less among the factory people. Just so
the material condition of the small rural proprietors in the canton of Zug is worse
than that of the factory hands, and the consumption of brandy there is considerable.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25745src" href="#xd31e25745">190</a>
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Bad housing conditions. These conditions often bring it about that the workman, returning
from his work, goes to the dram-shop instead of to his home. The dwelling is ordinarily
small, too small for a large family, without comfort or attractiveness, gloomy, and
often cold in winter, whereas in the <span class="corr" id="xd31e25803" title="Source: dramshop">dram-shop</span> there is light, warmth, and gaiety; comrades are there, and other topics of conversation
than the perpetual cares of life; and, above all, for a little money there may be
procured the means of forgetting for the moment the miseries of life.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25806src" href="#xd31e25806">191</a>
</p>
<p><i>e.</i> The uncertainty of existence and forced unemployment. The continual difficulties,
the anguish of not knowing what the future <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>has in store, produce a depression which may be driven away for the moment by the
consumption of alcohol. In the article by Richard Holst already cited, is found the
following answer given by a workman to the question: What are the principal causes
of alcoholism? “One of the principal factors is the difficulty of earning a living
for one’s family, and also—<i>and especially</i>—care, the eternal care for the morrow, which fastens upon the life of the working-man
like a bur, and which, as work becomes more rare, drives him to desperation. This
is the principal cause of alcoholism. Remove this care and men will drink much less
alcohol, for then the heart can open itself to joy instead of deadening itself, as
is at present almost a necessity. For many persons this deadening is the only, although
the fatal, means of ridding one’s self for a moment of the terrible thought, ‘What
will happen if I have the misfortune to be thrown out of work, or fall sick?’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25839src" href="#xd31e25839">192</a>
</p>
<p>Unemployment leads often to alcoholism. “Idleness is the mother of all the vices”,
says an old adage; but among all the vices, that which arises most directly from idleness
is without doubt drunkenness. What can a man do in the long hours when he has no work?
The rich man, educated, well brought up, finds the means of passing his time agreeably;
but the poor man has only the dram-shop, and is drawn thither irresistibly. The first
time he goes for a change from boredom; then from habit, and finally from a necessity
now become instinctive to his organism, which at a given moment feels the need of
something to stimulate the nerves. It is in alcoholic drinks that he finds what he
lacks.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25844src" href="#xd31e25844">193</a>
</p>
<p><i>f.</i> Ignorance. The lack of other means of enjoyment. One of the lesser causes of alcoholism,
but important enough to be named, is ignorance. There are a great many persons who
think that the regular consumption of great quantities of alcohol is not harmful,
who even believe that alcohol has nutritive value, and that consequently the consumption
of it is even useful.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25862src" href="#xd31e25862">194</a>
</p>
<p>From another point of view, however, ignorance, the lack of culture, emptiness of
life, are very important causes if not the most important causes of alcoholism. The
desire for pleasure is innate in every man, including the working-man, whose life
is a hard one in every way. But for him there are almost insurmountable difficulties
<span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>in enjoying all that is truly beautiful, all that nature, art, and science can offer
to man. This is due first, and principally, to material difficulties. In our present
society one can enjoy these things only with plenty of money. The wages of the working-man
are not enough for this. Often he is too tired when the day is over to take up anything
which requires effort, and his abode is too small and too badly arranged for reading
or any other form of distraction. However, the principal reason why the proletarian
enjoys the products of civilization but little is that his intelligence is not prepared
for it. His capacities have not been cultivated in this direction, for capitalism
has developed in a great number of people only the capacity for manual work to the
detriment of everything else. Dr. Augagneur, in his article already cited, has expressed
it as follows: “The true cause of alcoholism is entirely of the intellectual and moral
order; it is the insufficiency of cerebral activity, the intellectual indigence and
distress, the mental unemployment.
</p>
<p>“Every individual who, after the business of his calling is completed, is incapable
of busying himself with something else, is a fruitful soil for alcoholism. How many,
aside from their technical efficiency, are unfitted to think, to comprehend, to explain
anything whatever. When the workman, after ten or twelve hours of mechanical work,
leaves the factory, he is confused, does not know how to kill the time that must elapse
before he goes to bed; he drinks.…
</p>
<p>“Sundays and holidays ordinary labor is suppressed, the laborer wanders about the
streets, objectless, adrift, embarrassed by his liberty, and runs fatally aground
upon the dram-shop. The days of rest are days of drunkenness.
</p>
<p>“Our society suffers from this intellectual inaction, which is the true cause of alcoholism.
Most men, as soon as their trade no longer makes them work their arms and in some
cases their brains, know not which way to turn. Alcohol is their refuge, because it
procures for the nervous system sensations which take the place of the absent ideas.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25887src" href="#xd31e25887">195</a>
</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the abuse of alcohol is greatest among unskilled laborers<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25906src" href="#xd31e25906">196</a> and that it decreases everywhere that the workmen begin to organize in unions and
political parties, since these lead to the amelioration of conditions, material, intellectual,
and moral. In other words, drinking diminishes wherever the proletariat <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>is animated by an ideal. And it is also among those workmen who foresee the future
of their class and know what there is to do, that the ranks of total abstainers are
mainly recruited.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25914src" href="#xd31e25914">197</a>
</p>
<p>There are persons who maintain the thesis that poverty is not the principal cause
of alcoholism among the working classes. As a proof they say that the laborers who
earn the least (farm hands among others) are not those who drink the most, and that
an increase in wages often brings about a higher consumption of alcohol. They are
deceived, however. They lose sight of the fact that most agricultural laborers earn
so little that they cannot consume alcohol regularly, that beside the material poverty
there is an intellectual poverty, and that a slight amelioration of the one does not
produce simultaneously a diminution of the other. The abuse of alcohol has, on the
contrary, decreased regularly everywhere that the labor movement has brought about
a continuous amelioration of material and intellectual conditions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25936src" href="#xd31e25936">198</a>
</p>
<p>To close these remarks upon alcoholism among the workers I will quote the following
from Engels in which the causes are concisely set forth: “All possible temptations,
all allurements combine to bring the workers to drunkenness. Liquor is almost their
only source of pleasure, and all things conspire to make it accessible to them. The
working-man comes from his work tired, exhausted, finds his home comfortless, damp,
dirty, repulsive; he has urgent need of recreation, he <i>must</i> have something to make work worth his trouble, to make the prospect of the next day
endurable. His unnerved, uncomfortable, hypochondriac state of mind and body arising
from his unhealthy condition, and especially from indigestion, is aggravated beyond
endurance by the general conditions of his life, the uncertainty of his existence,
his dependence upon possible accidents and chances, and his inability to do anything
towards gaining an assured position. His enfeebled frame, weakened by bad air and
bad food, violently demands some external stimulus; his social need can be gratified
only in the public-house, he has absolutely no other place where he can meet his friends.
How can he be expected to resist temptation? It is morally and physically inevitable
that, under such circumstances, a very large number of working-men should fall into
intemperance. And apart from the chiefly physical influences which drive the working-man
into drunkenness, there is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>example of the great mass, the neglected education, the impossibility of protecting
the young from temptation, in many cases the direct influence of intemperate parents,
who give their own children liquor, the certainty of forgetting for an hour or two
the wretchedness and burden of life, and a hundred other circumstances so mighty that
the workers can, in truth, hardly be blamed for yielding to such overwhelming pressure.
Drunkenness has here ceased to be a vice for which the vicious can be held responsible;
it becomes a phenomenon, the necessary, inevitable effect of certain conditions upon
an object possessed of no volition in relation to those conditions. They who have
degraded the working-man to a mere object have the responsibility to bear.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25949src" href="#xd31e25949">199</a>
</p>
<p>As for the causes of alcoholism in the lower proletariat they are the same as for
the proletariat (if we except the two first named), only they are much more intense.
A very insufficient diet, frightful housing conditions, the demoralization consequent
upon inaction, ignorance, and the absolute lack of any intellectual life have made
of the man a brute who can forget his misery only by drinking.
</p>
<p>The same is true of prostitutes, among whom the abuse of alcohol is very wide spread.
Parent-Duchatelet says: “The taste of these women (prostitutes) for strong drink may
be considered to be general, although in different degrees; they contract it early,
and this taste ends by plunging some into the last state of brutishness. All the information
that I have gathered proves that they began drinking only to blunt their sensibilities;
gradually they become accustomed to it, and in a little while the habit becomes so
strong that it resists any return to virtue;…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25967src" href="#xd31e25967">200</a>
</p>
<p>Dr. Bonhoeffer says: “In many cases alcoholism is the result of the manner of life
of prostitutes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e25975src" href="#xd31e25975">201</a>
</p>
<p>The etiology of the abuse of alcohol in the well-to-do class is principally as follows:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> A part of the well-to-do class, those who live exclusively upon the income from their
invested capital, consider one of their occupations <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>to be the spending of a part of the surplus-value that they receive. Among the means
they make use of for this end is alcohol, which has also the faculty of dissipating
the ennui resulting from the emptiness of their existence.
</p>
<p>“Many persons, belonging for the most part to the well-to-do classes, have no fixed
occupation and feel the need of none. These persons do not know what it is to love
work for work’s sake. Having all that they need to live upon they imagine that work
exists only for those who have to earn their bread, and they themselves are created
for ‘<span lang="it">dolce far niente</span>.’ Unfortunately the ‘<span lang="it">far niente</span>’ is not always sweet! Having nothing to do, these individuals do not know how to
use their time; they are bored, they seek distractions and pleasures. Alcohol presents
itself to them as procuring the pleasure sought for, but as this enjoyment is only
momentary, they are forced to renew it and to prolong it.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26026src" href="#xd31e26026">202</a>
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Another part of the bourgeoisie is composed of those who pass their lives in the
fierce combat of competition, who are bent under the burden of material cares, and
whose mind is occupied with a single idea, that of getting money. This is why in these
surroundings also they frequently have recourse to alcohol to dissipate their vexations,
especially when things go badly.
</p>
<p>Having treated of alcoholism among the idle portion of the bourgeoisie, Kautsky says
in the study quoted above: “Not all, of course, and perhaps not even the majority,
of the moneyed class are idlers. Many work as long and hard as any working-man, even
if the work they do is often superfluous. But it is always one-sided nervous work.
Muscular exercise among the property-holding class has been constantly pushed ever
further into the background since the sixteenth century, and the demands upon the
nervous system have correspondingly increased. Besides the continual struggle with
the working-class, from whom the surplus-value is taken, there is going on an equally
uninterrupted battle of the spoilers among themselves for a share of this surplus-value.
All these battles are carried on today by nervous, not muscular, energy, and the contests
become constantly more bitter, the crises more tremendous, the battlefields more colossal,
the forces involved more incalculable.
</p>
<p>“Thus the nerves of the bourgeoisie become wrecked through their activity as well
as through their idleness.… If part of the bourgeoisie befuddle themselves out of
wantonness, another part grasp <span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>for stimulants or for means of benumbing themselves, alcohol, morphine, cocaine, any
thing to take away their feeling of sickness, to conquer their pains, to make them
forget their cares; and as it is with the proletariat, so is it with the moneyed class,
the power of resistance to these agents declines.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26050src" href="#xd31e26050">203</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, we must notice some causes of alcoholism which influence the whole population.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Imitation. This is reckoned among the important causes. In the first place there
are many children (for whom alcohol even in small quantities is extremely harmful)
who are accustomed to the use of alcohol as a consequence of the example set by their
families. Dr. R. Frölich mentioned the following facts at the 8th International Congress
against Alcohol at Vienna:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26065src" href="#xd31e26065">204</a>
</p>
<p>Out of 81,187 children from 6 to 14 years of age going to school in Vienna, there
were:

</p>
<p>But imitation is also important among those who have attained their full development.
In the course of time certain circles have taken up the habit of drinking, and any
one who frequents these circles must do the same under penalty of being looked down
upon. However, I think that the importance that abstainers give to imitation is exaggerated.
The number of those who are guilty of the <i>abuse</i> of alcohol from force of example and <i>nothing else</i> is certainly not very great. The other factors which have been at work at the same
time to bring about this result are not so obvious. Finally we must not forget that
imitation is not an independent factor; what does not exist cannot be imitated, and
consequently there must be other causes primarily responsible.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The climate. Although so much importance is not attached to climate as formerly,
it is nevertheless certain that a cold climate, especially if damp, favors the consumption
of alcohol, since this dissipates temporarily the discomfort resulting from cold and
humidity. It is for this reason that the inhabitants of the northern countries (for
example, England, Denmark, and Holland) consume on <span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>the average greater quantities of alcohol than southern countries (like Spain and
Italy). However the facts show that the social environment is a much more important
factor, and is apt to modify or overcome entirely the influence of climate. In Sweden
and Norway, for example, the consumption per capita is smaller than in countries farther
south, like Denmark and Holland. The great changes which occur at different times
in the same country, where the climate remains a constant factor, are a further proof
of the truth of this. And notwithstanding the climate the abuse of alcohol increases
greatly in the southern countries in which industrialism becomes more and more prevalent
(like northern Italy).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26154src" href="#xd31e26154">205</a>
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Race. There are many persons who attribute much importance in the etiology of alcoholism,
as in other social phenomena, to the influence of race. Where two nations differing
racially have not the same consumption of alcohol, they think they can explain the
difference by race. But in reasoning thus they forget that two nations may present
great differences in their manner of life, and that the greater or less consumption
of alcohol may be explained better by these than by race (without counting that racial
difference in the tendency to alcoholism is still to be accounted for somehow). To
cite an example; the peoples of the Germanic race are more intemperate, than the peoples
of the Latin race (a fact already explained by the climate, and further accounted
for by the cheapness of wine); this difference it is said is to be explained in part
by race. And yet the use of brandy in northern Italy increases with increasing industrialism,
northern industrial France gives a very high figure for brandy-consumption, and the
Belgians of the Latin race do not yield to their Germanic compatriots in the use of
alcohol.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26183src" href="#xd31e26183">206</a> The proverbial temperance of the Jews is often attributed to their race, while we
should ask whether this temperance is not rather to be attributed to their manner
of life, which differs from that of other peoples. It is probable that the Jewish
industrial workers, for example, who have broken with the habits of their coreligionists,
have also become consumers of spirituous beverages. As far as the diamond-cutters
of Amsterdam are concerned this fact is at least averred.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26189src" href="#xd31e26189">207</a> The tendency <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>which is observed among the Slavic peoples of becoming intoxicated periodically in
an extraordinary fashion, is attributed to race, but the same thing is observed in
other countries where wages are very low, thus preventing regular drinking, and limiting
the consumption of alcohol to paydays.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26210src" href="#xd31e26210">208</a>
</p>
<p>I believe that the influence of race upon alcoholism is enormously exaggerated, which
does not, however, imply that I deny its influence. The slight expansion of the use
of alcohol among the Mongolians (among whom, it is to be added, this is replaced by
other narcotics, principally by opium) is to be explained in part perhaps, by race.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> The psycho- and neuro-pathic condition of some persons enters into the etiology of
alcoholism in three ways. In the first place, the regular use of small quantities
of alcohol may, with the said persons, result in alcoholism. Secondly, quantities
of alcohol which have results imperceptible in the normal man, may cause drunkenness
in a very neuropathic person. Thirdly, alcoholism is present as the principal symptom
with dipsomaniacs, and as a secondary symptom in the case of persons suffering from
mania, melancholia, or paralytic dementia.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26221src" href="#xd31e26221">209</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After what we have said concerning the causes of the <i>consumption</i> of alcohol, we must add something about the production of it. As is the case with
most articles, the production of alcohol is capitalistic, that is to say, for the
sake of profit. Consumption is only a condition for attaining this end. If the profits
could be greater without production it would cease.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26244src" href="#xd31e26244">210</a> Aside from the producers, the state also has a great interest in the consumption
of alcohol, since it derives considerable revenue from it.
</p>
<p>The consequences of the fact that the production of alcohol is capitalistic have a
great social importance. To instance only some of these:
</p>
<p>First. The number of places where liquor may be drunk is very great. The more there
is consumed, the more profit there is for the producers and for the retailers. As
a consequence there is much advertising, and many dram-shops, in which the wages are
often <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>paid and workmen hired. These two things increase the profits of the dealer, but exercise
an indirect pressure upon the working-man to make him drink.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26252src" href="#xd31e26252">211</a>
</p>
<p>Second. The constantly decreasing price of alcohol. As we have seen above there is
a tendency in the present economic system to lower the price of commodities, since
each producer tries to increase his profits, if only temporarily, by seeking to improve
the processes of production. This is applicable to alcohol also.
</p>
<p>Third. The adulteration of alcoholic drinks. Under the capitalistic system the object
of production is not to furnish as perfect a product as possible, but to make as great
profits as possible. Hence comes the tendency among producers to adulterate their
wares, to deliver goods of poorer quality than they are supposed to be, for the purpose
of gaining greater profits. The adulteration so frequent with alcoholic beverages
has physical and psychical consequences most harmful to the consumers.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26265src" href="#xd31e26265">212</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The exposition which I have just given of the etiology of alcoholism points out the
principal causes of it, and proves that they are to be found in the last instance
almost wholly in the present constitution of society. It is possible that some one
will interpose the objection that this cannot be the case, that there must be, besides
pathological causes, individual causes, since it happens that among persons living
in the same environment some become alcoholics and others do not.
</p>
<p>This last fact is incontestable, but it is partly to be explained by the fact that,
while there are persons who live in environments that are very similar, there are
no two individuals whose surroundings are exactly the same. Take, for example, two
workmen. The one may have passed his youth in circles where they drink little or no
alcohol, and where it is pointed out to him that abstinence is very salutary, while
the other sees only examples of intemperance. It may be that here is the explanation
of the fact that the first has remained temperate, while the second has not, although
the two live in surroundings almost alike.
</p>
<p>But suppose that the environment is and has always been exactly the same for a group
of persons, we shall see then that the tendency toward alcoholism is not the same
for each individual. No one will be able to dispute the fact, however, that it is
the environment <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>that is the cause of the abuse of alcohol. Individual differences bring it about that
one man is more drawn to the use of alcohol than another, but circumstances explain
why the first has <i>become</i> alcoholic. These differences can never explain why, at a certain period, the abuse
of alcohol has, or has not, become an almost universal phenomenon.
</p>
<p>The proofs are plain. In examining, for example, a period like that in which capitalism
took its rise in England, as it is described by Engels in his “Condition of the Working
Class”, a period, that is to say, in which the working class found itself in very
disadvantageous material and moral conditions, we see that the workers, with rare
exceptions, were consumers of alcohol, and largely abused it. Since that time conditions
have improved. The moral and material plane having been raised, those whose tendency
toward alcohol was less strong and who had more marked innate moral qualities, ceased
misusing alcohol. As conditions improve still further those who are weaker follow
little by little the same road to temperance. This process may be observed going on
among unorganized workmen, with whom the tendency to drink is generally great. As
soon as they begin to organize, and in measure as their organization is developed,
we see that first the most intelligent, etc., among them become temperate, and that
little by little these are followed by the others.
</p>
<p>It is a biological fact that men always and everywhere present qualitative differences.
But this constant factor does not give an explanation of the changes which society
undergoes, and is not, therefore, of great importance to sociology, which, while taking
it into account, has for its task the explanation of the changes in question. And
it is just those changes in the use of alcoholic beverages which have taken place
during the course of the centuries, which show that the social environment is the
principal cause of alcoholism.
</p>
<p>In ancient times alcoholism was unknown. It is true that among the Israelites, for
example, the abuse of alcohol at times occurred, but the fact that no importance was
attached to it proves that alcoholism properly speaking did not exist.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26286src" href="#xd31e26286">213</a> Nor was it to be met with among the ancient Greeks. At every meal, and at their reunions
they drank wine diluted; it is unnecessary to say that these “symposia” were not looked
down upon by the Greeks, but on the contrary were highly regarded. “Greek opinion
found nothing improper in intoxication, only a certain self-control in drunkenness
was held to <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>be indispensable. Gross and violent conduct was, like the drinking of unmixed wine,
a custom of the barbarians, and unworthy of a Greek.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26295src" href="#xd31e26295">214</a> Nor was ancient Rome any more acquainted with alcoholism, though among the Romans,
coarse in comparison with the Greeks and demoralized by their immense wealth, the
abuse of alcohol was often met with. But it was only the very small group of the rich
who were addicted to it. When the barbarians annihilated the ancient world they were
not capable of assimilating the civilization of the peoples whom they had just subjugated,
while they adopted their pleasures, a thing which did not require so high a state
of development. This is the cause of the great abuse of alcohol among the Germans.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26311src" href="#xd31e26311">215</a> The uncertainty of existence, and the miserable conditions during the migrations
of these peoples were favorable to this abuse.
</p>
<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the abuse of alcohol had reached a high degree
of development among the rich. The cause of this was the birth of capitalism, by which
great wealth was accumulated in the hands of a few without their having occasion to
place a great part of it as new capital. To this fact was joined a low degree of culture,
and it thus came about that the wealthy of the period spent enormous sums for eating
and drinking.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26325src" href="#xd31e26325">216</a>
</p>
<p>The discovery in the middle of the sixteenth century of the distillation of spirits
from grain brought about a considerable cheapening in the price of strong drink, which
thus came within the reach of the poor. (Arab physicians had long before discovered
how to extract brandy from wine, but this in the beginning was only used medicinally.)
The great poverty occasioned by the Thirty Years’ War increased the use of liquor
enormously, and the birth of the industrial proletariat contributed equally to the
same result. Mention is made for the first time of the regular use of liquor <i>to increase the amount of work done</i>, in 1550 among the Hungarian miners, the first category of workmen who lived under
conditions almost identical with those of the modern industrial proletariat. With
the continually increasing development of capitalism King Alcohol began his triumphal
march, which has continued without any great obstacle to the present day. Alcoholism
has its deeper causes in the material <span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>intellectual and moral poverty created by the economic system now in force. It is
with reason that Professor Gruber has said: “We cannot shut our eyes to the truth
that alcohol is not without basis in our present order of society. Without it life
would long ago have become unendurable for the suffering part of the population.”

<h3 class="label">CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h3 class="main">MILITARISM.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We may be very brief upon the correlation of militarism and the present economic system.
This correlation is so clear that there are few persons who deny it. The motives which,
under all earlier modes of production, have engendered wars are principally of an
economic nature. But besides these there have been at times others; but we have not
to enquire here what was in the last analysis their correlation with the mode of production
of that day. The relation between capitalism and war is always so close that we can
find in the economic life the direct causes of the wars waged under the empire of
capitalism.
</p>
<p>As we have seen above in our exposition of the present economic system, a part of
the surplus-value that comes to the moneyed class is invested as new capital. The
continually increasing amount of capital does not readily find investment in full
in a country where capitalism is already in force. This is why the moneyed class desires
to invest a part of the surplus-value in countries whither capitalism has not yet
penetrated. If the inhabitants of the country chosen as field of operation are opposed
to this, or if the same country is coveted by other capitalistic powers, the resulting
antagonism generally leads to war.
</p>
<p>In the second place, the producers can sell in their own country only a part of the
increasing quantity of their products; whence come their efforts to find an outlet
into other countries. But as capitalism expands with increasing rapidity over the
whole world, the difficulty of finding a country in a position to buy, or to which
capitalism has not yet penetrated, becomes greater and greater. Encounters with other
capitalistic powers pursuing the same end are the inevitable consequence.
</p>
<p>It is upon the State that the task is imposed of finding new territories <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>where capital may be invested, or new outlets for goods which do not find purchasers
in the country where they are produced. Beside the duty of the State to maintain a
certain order in a society confused and complicated through the nature of our economic
life (civil and criminal jurisprudence), there is its more important duty of warding
off other groups of competitors, or even at need attacking them by force of arms.
</p>
<p>But the army serves not only to act against the foreigner, it has equally a domestic
duty to fulfil. In the cases where the police cannot maintain order the army reinforces
them. The army must especially then be active at the time of great strikes, when so-called
free labor is to be protected, that is when employers are trying to replace the striking
workmen with others who, in consequence of their poverty, or their lack of organization,
put their personal interests above those of their comrades. Also it has its part to
play in connection with great political movements, like that to obtain universal suffrage,
for example.
</p>
<p>Our present militarism is, therefore, a consequence of capitalism. The double duty
of the army proves it; for its function is to furnish the bourgeoisie with the means
of restraining the proletariat at home, and of repulsing or attacking the forces of
foreign countries.

midst it lives. The workers speak other dialects, have other thoughts and ideals,
other customs and moral principles, a different religion, and other politics than

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e20517src">35</a></span> Westermarck believes that there is an innate aversion to sexual relationships between
persons who have lived together from childhood; and that the sexual aversion that
exists between near blood-relations is in consequence of the fact that these persons
have always lived together. This instinct would thus have been acquired by natural
selection, since those who did not have it would run more danger than the others of
disappearing in consequence of the injurious effects of such unions. (<i>Op. cit.</i>, chaps. xiv and xv.) Cunow on the other hand makes the point that there cannot be
an innate aversion between persons who have been raised together, for marriages between
such persons do take place, and are not thought at all immoral or contrary to nature.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Crime belongs to the category of punishable acts. However, as the term is applicable
to only a part of such acts, it is necessary to be more exact. The best way to do
this, in my opinion, is to exclude successively all the groups of acts which are punishable
without being crimes.
</p>
<p>The first exclusion is in connection with the question, “Who is it that punishes?”
You cannot call that a crime against which one or several individuals take action
of their own motion, and where the social group to which they belong does not move
as such. In this case the word “punish” is an improper term, for the act in question
is one of personal vengeance. Nor can you apply the name of crime to the act of a
group of persons forming a social entity, against an analogous group. The reaction
of the second group called forth by such act is not properly punishment, but “blood-”
or “group-vengeance”, and is in reality nothing but a kind of war.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26402src" href="#xd31e26402">3</a>
</p>
<p>The second exclusion concerns the nature of the punishment. Acts <span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>which bring no other punishment than moral disapprobation are not reckoned as crimes.
They are not so called unless they are threatened with something more severe than
this.
</p>
<p>The provisional result is, then, as follows: A crime is an act committed within a
group of persons that form a social unit, and whose author is punished by the group
(or a part of it) as such, or by organs designated for this purpose, and this by a
penalty whose nature is considered to be more severe than that of moral disapprobation.
This definition, however, considers only the formal side of the conception of crime;
it says nothing as to its essence. It is proper, then, to consider next the material
side.
</p>
<p>Crime is an act.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26458src" href="#xd31e26458">4</a> The question which presents itself first of all is this: Is crime considered from
a biological point of view an abnormal act? The answer to this, which is of the highest
importance for the etiology of crime, must be negative. From a biological point of
view almost all crimes must be ranked as normal acts. The process which takes place
in the brain of the gendarme when he kills a poacher who resists arrest is identical
with that which takes place in the brain of the poacher killing the gendarme who pursues
him. It is only the social environment which classes the second act rather than the
first as a crime. From the biological point of view homicide is not an abnormal act.
Sociology and history prove that men have always killed when they thought it necessary.
No one would maintain, for example, that those who take part in a war are biologically
abnormal.
</p>
<p>The same observation may be applied to assaults. No anthropologist would maintain
that a policeman clubbing a mob of strikers was performing a biologically abnormal
act, or that the strikers were abnormal because they did not choose to let themselves
be maltreated without defending themselves. It is only the social circumstances which
class this defense as a crime, and cause the action of the policeman to be considered
otherwise.
</p>
<p>The same thing is true with regard to theft. For centuries it was considered the right
of the soldiers to pillage the country of the conquered (and in colonial wars it is
still done at times). Soldiers are not, however, from this fact considered to be biologically
abnormal individuals. And yet there is no biological difference between these acts
and those of the ordinary thief; for anthropology does not ask whether one steals
on a large scale or on a small.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26464src" href="#xd31e26464">5</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb379a">[<a href="#pb379a">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>Continuing our researches into the essence of crime, it is obvious that it is an immoral
act, and one of a serious character. Why do we find any act immoral? This question
cannot be answered by asking of each individual separately, Why do you think such
and such an act immoral? Moral disapprobation is primarily a question of feeling;
ordinarily we take no account of why any given act is approved or disapproved by us.
Sociology alone can solve the problem by taking the acts considered as immoral in
relation with the social organization in which they take place. And in treating the
matter thus we observe that the acts called immoral are those which are harmful to
the interests of a group of persons united by the same interests. Since the social
structure is changing continually, the ideas of what is immoral (and consequently
of what is or is not criminal) change with these modifications.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26509src" href="#xd31e26509">6</a>
</p>
<p>Considered in this way from the material side, a crime is an anti-social act, an act
which is harmful in a considerable degree to the interests of a certain group of persons.
This definition is not yet complete, however, for many acts of this nature are not
crimes.
</p>
<p>The best thing to do in order to find what is lacking in this definition is to examine
a concrete case. A short time ago there was added to the Dutch penal code a new article
threatening with a penal term of some years the railroad employe who went out on a
strike. The proposal of this law, presented after a partial strike of the railroad
employes, aroused great indignation on the part of organized labor, while the bourgeoisie
in general regarded a strike as an immoral act which would henceforth be followed
by a severe penalty. Notwithstanding the violent opposition on the part of the deputies
of the labor party the plan was accepted.
</p>
<p>It is clear that what must be added to our definition (already contained implicitly
in the formal definition) is that the act must be prejudicial to the interests of
those who have the power at their command. If, in the case cited above, the deputies
of the proletariat had had the majority the Dutch penal code would contain no penalties
against railroad employes on a strike. Power then is the necessary condition for those
who wish to class a certain act as a crime.
</p>
<p>It follows that in every society which is divided into a ruling class and a class
ruled penal law has been principally constituted according <span class="pageNum" id="pb380">[<a href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>to the will of the former. We must at once add that the present legal prescriptions
are not always directed against the class of those ruled, but that most of them are
directed against acts that are prejudicial to the interests of both classes equally
(for example, homicide, rape, etc.). These acts would without doubt continue to be
considered criminal if the power were to pass into the hands of those who are at present
the governed. However, in every existing penal code hardly any act is punished if
it does not injure the interests of the dominant class as well as the other, and the
law touching it protects only the interests of the class dominated. The rare exceptions
are explained by the fact that the lower classes are not wholly without power.
</p>
<p>Before closing our observations we must put the question, What is the object of punishment?
It seems to me that there are elements of different nature in punishment as prescribed
in our present penal codes. To begin with the object of punishment is to be found
in the feelings of vengeance excited by the crime, for which satisfaction is desired.
But after this punishment has three things in view:
</p>
<p>First, To put the criminal where he can do no further harm, either permanently or
for a certain period.
</p>
<p>Second, To inspire the criminal, and other persons as well, with a fear of committing
crime.
</p>
<p>Third, To reform the criminal as far as possible.
</p>
<p>Most criminologists do not admit that punishment is still in great part a manifestation
of the desire for vengeance (although regulated). Nevertheless it is indubitable that
he who desires that some one shall be punished solely because he has committed a misdeed,
and without his punishment’s being of any use to the criminal or to others, wishes
simply to satisfy his feelings of revenge. The most subtle theories cannot refute
this fact. Those who from the height of their knowledge disdain the primitive peoples
who practice the rule of “eye for eye, tooth for tooth”, are nevertheless on the same
plane in this matter, as those they scorn.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26530src" href="#xd31e26530">7</a>
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say that the minority that wishes to exclude all idea of vengeance
from the penal code, and sees in it only a means of securing the safety of society,
and, if possible, of reforming the criminal, is at present still very small, so that
the ideas of this group are almost never realized in our present penalties.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26542src" href="#xd31e26542">8</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb381a">[<a href="#pb381a">381</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is our conclusion, then, that a crime is an act committed within a group of persons
forming a social unit; that it prejudices the interests of all, or of those of the
group who are powerful; that, for this reason, the author of the crime is punished
by the group (or a part of the group) as such or by specially ordained instruments,
and this by a penalty more severe than moral disapprobation.
</p>
<p>To find the causes of crime we must, then, first solve the question: “Why does an
individual do acts injurious to the interests of those with whom he forms a social
unit?”, or in other words<span class="corr" id="xd31e26562" title="Source: ;">:</span> “Why does a man act egoistically?”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What are the causes of egoistic acts? How does it happen that one man does harm to
another? The answers that have been given to this primeval question may be divided
into two groups. The first group attributes the cause to the man himself, the second
to his environment.
</p>
<p>The great majority of persons who treat of this question settle it in favor of innate
egoism. They are of the opinion that man is egoistic by nature and that environment
can produce no change in this (this is implied in the Christian doctrine of original
sin). This opinion, in order to be accepted as true, needs facts to prove that egoism
has always and everywhere been the same among men.
</p>
<p>Others, among whom are most of the well-known sociologists, also consider egoism as
a fundamental trait of man, but are at the same time of the opinion that little by
little egoism has decreased, that altruism has developed, and that this process continues.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26598src" href="#xd31e26598">10</a> For this hypothesis to be correct it must be shown by the facts:
</p>
<p>First. That the peoples of a much lower degree of social evolution than ours show
much more egoistic traits of character.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26619src" href="#xd31e26619">11</a>
</p>
<p>Second. That the animals from whom man has descended are inveterate egoists.
</p>
<p>This theory is naturally of the highest importance for criminal <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>science, and it becomes still more so from the fact that, according to Professor Lombroso,
crime is a manifestation of atavism, that is, that some individuals present anew traits
of character belonging to their very remote ancestors. The criminal would thus be
a savage in our present society. We must therefore examine to see whether the said
theory is correct.
</p>
<p>We have only to consult one of the standard works on zoölogy to perceive that there
is no basis in this science to uphold the theory. There are some animals that are
complete egoists. Two harpies (South American birds of prey) for example, upon meeting
will attack each other at once and will fight till one is conquered. Other animals,
on the contrary, show very altruistic traits of character. The following extract from
Darwin’s “Descent of Man”, is one of many proofs which might be adduced: “Animals
of many kinds are social;… We will confine our attention to the higher social animals;
and pass over insects, although some of these are social, and aid one another in many
important ways. The most common mutual service in the higher animals is to warn one
another of danger by means of the united senses of all. Every sportsman knows, as
Dr. Jaeger remarks, how difficult it is to approach animals in a herd or troop. Wild
horses and cattle do not, I believe, make any danger-signal; but the attitude of any
one of them who first discovers an enemy, warns the others. Rabbits stamp loudly on
the ground with their hind-feet as a signal; sheep and chamois do the same with their
fore-feet, uttering likewise a whistle. Many birds, and some mammals, post sentinels,
which in the case of seals are said generally to be the females. The leader of a troop
of monkeys acts as the sentinel, and utters cries expressive both of danger and of
safety. Social animals perform many little services for each other: horses nibble,
and cows lick each other, on any spot which itches<span class="corr" id="xd31e26631" title="Source: :">;</span> monkeys search each other for external parasites; and Brehm states that after a troop
of the Cercopithecus griseo-viridis has rushed through a thorny brake, each monkey
stretches itself on a branch, and another monkey sitting by, ‘conscientiously’ examines
its fur, and extracts every thorn or burr.
</p>
<p>“Animals also render more important services to one another: thus wolves and some
other beasts of prey hunt in packs, and aid one another in attacking their victims.
Pelicans fish in concert. The Hamádryas baboons turn over stones to find insects,
etc.; and when they come to a large one, as many as can stand round, turn it over
together and share the booty. Social animals mutually defend each other. Bull bisons
in North America, when there is danger, drive the <span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>cows and calves to the middle of the herd, whilst they defend the outside.… In Abyssinia,
Brehm encountered a great troop of baboons, who were crossing a valley: some had already
ascended the opposite mountain, and some were still in the valley: the latter were
attacked by the dogs, but the old males immediately hurried down from the rocks, and
with mouths widely opened roared so fearfully, that the dogs quickly drew back. They
were again encouraged to the attack; but by this time all the baboons had reascended
the heights, excepted a young one, about six months old, who, loudly calling for aid,
climbed on a block of rock, and was surrounded. Now one of the largest males, a true
hero, came down again from the mountain, slowly went to the young one, coaxed him,
and triumphantly led him away—the dogs being too much astonished to make an attack.
I cannot resist giving another scene which was witnessed by this same naturalist;
an eagle seized a young Cercopithecus, which, by clinging to a branch, was not at
once carried off; it cried loudly for assistance, upon which the other members of
the troop, with much uproar, rushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled
out so many feathers, that he no longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape.…
</p>
<p>“It is certain that associated animals have a feeling of love for each other, which
is not felt by non-social adult animals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26640src" href="#xd31e26640">12</a>
</p>
<p>Later I shall treat of the question why some species of animals show altruistic proclivities
while others do not. At present I wish to inquire whether peoples showing a much lower
degree of civilization than our own are much more egoistic.
</p>
<p>Nansen, the celebrated explorer, in speaking of the Eskimos, among whom he sojourned
for some time, says: “The Greenlander is of all God’s creatures gifted with the best
disposition. Good-humor, peaceableness, and evenness of temper are the most prominent
features in his character. He is eager to live on as good a footing as possible with
his fellow-men and therefore refrains from offending them and much more from using
coarse terms of abuse. He is very loth to contradict another even should he be saying
what he knows to be false. If he does so, he takes care to word his remonstrance in
the mildest possible form, and it would be very hard indeed for him to say right out
that the other was lying. He is chary of <span class="pageNum" id="pb384">[<a href="#pb384">384</a>]</span>telling other people truths that he thinks will be unpleasant to them; in such cases
he chooses the vaguest expressions, even with reference to such indifferent things
as wind and weather. His peaceableness even goes so far that when anything is stolen
from him, which seldom happens, he does not as a rule reclaim it even if he knows
who has taken it. The result is that there is seldom or never any quarreling among
them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26665src" href="#xd31e26665">13</a>
</p>
<p>“The only thing that makes him [the Eskimo] really unhappy is to see others in want,
and therefore he shares with them whenever he has anything to share.”
</p>
<p>“The Greenlander is, on the whole, like a sympathetic child with respect to the needs
of others; <i>his first social law is to help his neighbor</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26673src" href="#xd31e26673">14</a>
</p>
<p>“One of the most prominent and attractive traits in the Eskimo’s moral character is
certainly his integrity.… It is of special importance for the Eskimo that he should
be able to rely with confidence upon his neighbors and his fellow-men; and it is the
first condition of this mutual confidence, on which depends all united action in the
battle for life, that every man should be upright in his dealings with his neighbors.
The Eskimo therefore regards it as in the highest degree dishonorable to steal from
his house-mates or from his fellow-villagers, and it is very seldom that anything
of the sort occurs.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26679src" href="#xd31e26679">15</a>
</p>
<p>“The worst thing that can happen to a Greenlander is to be made ridiculous in the
eyes of his fellows, and to be scoffed at by them.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26685src" href="#xd31e26685">16</a>
</p>
<p>With regard to the American Indians living in the region of the Columbia river, Dr.
Waitz makes the following statement: “The qualities regarded as virtues by these peoples
are honesty and love of truth, courage, obedience to parents and chiefs, and love
of wife and child; and the Salish, whose moral ideals are here especially indicated,
in general come up to these requirements very well. With them and with their cousins,
the ‘<span lang="fr">Pends-d’Oreilles</span>’ and Spokane, crimes are very rare, and a mere rebuke, administered by the chief,
is of great effectiveness. Old age, too, finds among the Salish benevolent support
and care, though children who have the misfortune to lose their fathers have often
a sad lot, their property being frequently taken from them. Most of these peoples
are upright and honest, live together in the most peaceable fashion, and have friendly
intercourse with the whites.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26694src" href="#xd31e26694">17</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span></p>
<p>G. Catlin, one of the authors who are best informed upon everything concerning the
North American Indians, says of their character:
</p>
<p>“I have roamed about from time to time during seven or eight years, visiting and associating
with, some three or four hundred thousand of these people, under an almost infinite
variety of circumstances; and from the very many and decided voluntary acts of their
hospitality and kindness I feel bound to pronounce them, by nature, a kind and hospitable
people. I have been welcomed generally in their country, and treated to the best that
they could give me, without any charges made for my board; they have often escorted
me through their enemies’ country at some hazard to their own lives, and aided me
in passing mountains and rivers with my awkward baggage; and under all of these circumstances
of exposure, no Indian ever betrayed me, struck me a blow, or stole from me a shilling’s
worth of my property that I am aware of.
</p>
<p>“This is saying a great deal, (and proving it too, if the reader believe me) in favour
of the virtues of these people; when it is borne in mind, as it should be, that there
is no law in their land to punish a man for theft—that locks and keys are not known
in their country—that the commandments have never been divulged amongst them; nor
can any human retribution fall upon the head of thief, save the disgrace which attaches
as a stigma to his character, in the eyes of his people about him.
</p>
<p>“And thus in these little communities, strange as it may seem, in the absence of all
systems of jurisprudence, I have often beheld peace and happiness, and quiet, reigning
supreme, for which even kings and emperors might envy them. I have seen rights and
virtue protected, and wrongs redressed; and I have seen conjugal, filial and paternal
affection in the simplicity and contentedness of nature. I have unavoidably, formed
warm and enduring attachments to some of these men which I do not wish to forget—who
have brought me near to their hearts, and in our final separation have embraced me
in their arms, commended me and my affairs to the keeping of the great Spirit.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26704src" href="#xd31e26704">18</a>
</p>
<p>In treating of the question of which of the two are the happier, the civilized nations
or the peoples he visited, the same author says:
</p>
<p>“I have long looked with the eye of a critic, into the jovial faces of these sons
of the forest, unfurrowed with cares—where the agonizing feeling of poverty had never
stamped distress upon the brow. I have <span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span>watched the bold, intrepid step—the proud, yet dignified deportment of Nature’s man,
in fearless freedom, with a soul unalloyed by mercenary lusts, too great to yield
to laws or power except from God. As these independent fellows are all joint-tenants
of the soil, they are all rich, and none of the steepings of comparative poverty can
strangle their just claims to renown. Who (I could ask) can look without admiring,
into a society where peace and harmony prevail—where virtue is cherished—where rights
are protected and wrongs are redressed—with no laws, but the laws of honour, which
are the supreme laws of their land. Trust the boasted virtues of civilized society
for awhile, with all its intellectual refinements, to such a tribunal, and then write
down the degradation of the ‘lawless savage’ and our transcendent virtues.”
</p>
<p>Lewis H. Morgan, after passing a great part of his life among the Iroquois, says with
regard to them: “All the members of an Iroquois gens were personally free, and they
were bound to defend each other’s freedom; they were equal in privileges and in personal
rights, the sachem and chiefs claiming no superiority; and they were a brotherhood
bound together by the ties of kin. Liberty, equality, and fraternity, though never
formulated, were cardinal principles of the gens. These facts are material, because
the gens was the unit of a social and governmental system, the foundation upon which
Indian society was organized. A structure composed of such units would of necessity
bear the impress of their character, for as the unit so the compound. It serves to
explain that sense of independence and personal dignity universally an attribute of
Indian character.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26715src" href="#xd31e26715">19</a>
</p>
<p>He describes the hospitality of the peoples mentioned as follows: “Among the Iroquois
hospitality was an established usage. If a man entered an Indian house in any of their
villages, whether a villager, or a stranger, it was the duty of the women therein
to set food before him. An omission to do this would have been a discourtesy amounting
to an affront. If hungry, he ate; if not hungry, courtesy required that he should
taste the food and thank the giver. This would be repeated at every house he entered,
and at whatever hour in the day. As a custom it was upheld by a rigorous public sentiment.
The same hospitality was extended to strangers from their own and from other tribes.
Upon the advent of the European race among them it was also extended to them. This
characteristic of barbarous society, wherein food was the principal concern of life,
is a remarkable fact. The law of hospitality, as administered by the American aborigines,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>tended to the final equalization of subsistence. Hunger and destitution could not
exist at one end of an Indian village or in one section of an encampment while plenty
prevailed elsewhere in the same village or encampment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26722src" href="#xd31e26722">20</a>
</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;R. Wallace speaks as follows of the primitive population of South America and the
Indian Archipelago: “I have lived with communities of savages in South America and
in the East, who have no laws or law courts but the public opinion of the village
freely expressed. Each man scrupulously respects the rights of his fellow, and any
infraction of these rights rarely or never takes place. In such a community, all are
nearly equal. There are none of those wide distinctions, of education and ignorance,
wealth and poverty, master and servant, which are the product of our civilization;
there is none of the wide-spreading division of labor, which, while it increases wealth,
produces<span></span> also conflicting interests; there is not that severe competition and struggle for
existence, or for wealth, which the dense population of civilized countries inevitably
creates. All incitements to great crimes are thus wanting, and petty ones are repressed,
partly by the influence of public opinion, but chiefly by that natural sense of justice
and of his neighbor’s right, which seems to be, in some degree, inherent in every
race of man.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26734src" href="#xd31e26734">21</a>
</p>
<p>In his work, “Village Communities in the East and West”, H.&nbsp;S. Maine says:
</p>
<p>“Whenever a corner is lifted up of the veil which hides from us the primitive condition
of mankind, even of such parts of it as we know to have been destined to civilisation,
there are two positions, now very familiar to us, which <span class="corr" id="xd31e26746" title="Source: seems">seem</span> to be signally falsified by all we are permitted to see—All men are brothers, and
all men are equal. The scene before us is rather that which the animal world presents
to the mental eye of those who have the courage to bring home to themselves the facts
answering to the memorable theory of Natural Selection. Each fierce little community
is perpetually at war with its neighbour, tribe with tribe, village with village.
The never-ceasing attacks of the strong on the weak end in the manner expressed by
the monotonous formula which so often recurs in the pages of Thucydides, ‘they put
the men to the sword, the women and children they sold into slavery.’ Yet, even amid
all this cruelty and carnage, we find the <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>germs of ideas, which have spread over the world. There is still a place and a sense
in which men are brothers and equals. The universal belligerency is the belligerency
of one total group, tribe, or village, with another; but in the interior of the groups
the regimen is one not of conflict and confusion but rather of ultra-legality. The
men who composed the primitive communities believed themselves to be kinsmen in the
most literal sense of the word; and surprising as it may seem, there are a multitude
of indications that in one stage of thought they must have regarded themselves as
equals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26751src" href="#xd31e26751">22</a>
</p>
<p>Scores of pages might be filled with facts proving that the primitive peoples of all
races and in all parts of the world were not only not egoistic in their relations
with the people they lived among, but rather the contrary. In conclusion I wish to
note the opinions of two distinguished sociologists, Steinmetz and Kovalewsky, opinions
which derive significance from the great ethnological knowledge of these authors.
</p>
<p>At the Fifth Congress of Criminal Anthropology Dr. Steinmetz, in speaking upon the
explanation of crime by the hypothesis of atavism, says: “It is not at all probable
that our true born-criminal resembles the normal savage. The former is characterized
by his ferocious egoism, while the latter is nothing if not a devoted member of the
group whose customs he respects and whose interests he defends; the savage is very
tender toward the children whom the criminal abandons; the savage is only cruel toward
the enemy, the criminal toward all the world.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26757src" href="#xd31e26757">23</a>
</p>
<p>After having cited different altruistic traits of primitive peoples Kovalewsky says:
“The enumeration would wear out your patience if one were to cite all the proofs that
travelers give of the care that savages and barbarians have for their mutual welfare,
and the fulness of their charity. To these facts, which indicate the prolonged existence
of a sort of communism, others correspond.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26765src" href="#xd31e26765">24</a>
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that no one, taking the above facts into consideration, will maintain
that man has always and everywhere shown the same egoistic traits, or that there has
been a gradual evolution from egoism towards altruism.
</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that primitive peoples <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>present under all circumstances the altruistic characteristics that I have mentioned.
I have already remarked that the position of woman is in general very dependent. In
general the primitive peoples are very fond of their children and give them very tender
care. Nevertheless infanticide is not uncommon among those who are at a low stage
of civilization. And I have already remarked that among nomadic peoples the sick and
aged were often abandoned. Here are then contradictions which it is necessary to explain.
</p>
<p>Apparently—but only apparently—an evolution from egoism towards altruism has really
taken place and has not yet ceased. This appearance is the effect of the alteration
in the character of the egoism under the present economic system; it has become less
<i>violent</i> than at earlier periods. The fight is no longer carried on with fire-arms or cold
steel, but with other weapons no less dangerous, and this is what is generally lost
sight of. We note that in ancient times the prisoners were killed; that later they
were sold into slavery; that slavery was superseded by serfdom, which in its turn
gave place to free labor.
</p>
<p>But it is not always a growing altruistic sentiment that has been the motive in these
changes. The life of prisoners of war has not been spared from reasons of humanity,
but because the extension of the productivity of labor made it more profitable to
make a prisoner work than to kill him. And slavery was not abolished because slave-owners
had become less egoistic, but because it was more profitable to make free laborers
work than to make slaves do so.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26799src" href="#xd31e26799">25</a> We cannot speak of the diminution of egoism, but of the moderating of violence in
the course of time. It cannot be maintained that a capitalist who tries by a lock-out
to force his workmen to break with their union, in order that he may escape the danger
of a decrease in his profits through a strike, and who in this way condemns them and
their families to hunger, is less egoistic than the slave-owner driving his slaves
to harder labor. The former does not use force—it is useless—he has a surer weapon
at his command, the suffering with which he can strike his workmen; he <i>seems</i> less egoistic, but in reality is as egoistic as the latter. The great speculator
who, by manipulating the market, forces thousands of persons to pay more for the necessaries
of life, and to become his tributaries as it were, is not less egoistic than the robber-baron
of the middle ages who, arms in hand, forced the traveling <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>merchants to pay him tribute. The difference is merely that the former attains his
end without using violence like the latter. Capitalism is a system of exploitation
in which, in place of the exploited person’s being robbed he is compelled by poverty
to use all his powers for the benefit of the exploiter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26818src" href="#xd31e26818">26</a>
</p>
<p>The same thing is true of colonial history. At first the aborigines of the countries
explored by the Europeans were often pillaged and massacred. This system has long
been abandoned, not from altruism however, but because it is more profitable to make
a conquered people work than to pillage and exterminate them. When they do not submit
voluntarily, force is used as heretofore.
</p>
<p>The apparent improvement has yet another cause. Christianity preaches “Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thy self.” And since this maxim has been often preached and many
Christians have it always in their mouths, men come to believe that it is really put
into practice. The contrary is true. The fact that the duty of altruism is so much
insisted upon is the <i>most convincing proof that it is not generally practiced</i> or it would not be so much spoken and preached about. There are many persons in our
days who ask nothing better than to see men act altruistically, but they preach in
the wilderness; their wish has not come true. Present society is moulded by egoism.
The egoism is less violent, however, and more disguised.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Before speaking of the real causes of egoism and altruism it may be well to attempt
to answer the question, Whence come these inexact ideas? It is not difficult, in my
opinion, to explain how it comes about that many men believe that the “<span lang="la">homo homini lupus</span>” of Hobbes has been true always and everywhere. The adherents of this opinion have
studied principally men who live under capitalism, or under civilization; their correct
conclusion has been that egoism is the predominant characteristic of these men, and
they have adopted the simplest explanation of the phenomenon and say that this trait
is inborn.
</p>
<p>If they had known the periods anterior to civilization, they would have noted that
the “<span lang="la">homo homini lupus</span>” is an historical phenomenon applicable during a relatively short period,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26847src" href="#xd31e26847">27</a> and that consequently it is impossible that egoism should be innate in man. However
great have been the social modifications during the period of civilization, the principal
aim of men has always been, and still is, to acquire <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>personal wealth, and men still remain divided into classes, that is into groups whose
economic interests are contrary. This is why an examination of the earlier periods
is of such high importance for sociology.
</p>
<p>An erroneous interpretation of the Darwinian theory has also contributed to bring
about the strange notion of the eternal character of the struggle of all against all.
Darwin himself maintains nothing of the sort. In his “Origin of Species” he says in
the clearest terms that the struggle between the individuals of the same species does
not at all happen in every species: “There must in every case be a struggle for existence,
either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of
distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26858src" href="#xd31e26858">28</a>
</p>
<p>The explanation of the second hypothesis, that of the evolution from egoism towards
altruism, is more complicated. In the first place the facts adduced in support of
it are not numerous, and they serve rather to illustrate a theory than to furnish
the materials by which it may be justified. In the second place a part of the ethnological
materials in relation to the question it has been impossible to utilize. They have
been collected partly by persons convinced beforehand of the superiority of Christian
morality to every other system, and who consequently disapprove of everything opposed
to it, and partly by persons whose own conduct has caused the enmity manifested by
the peoples with whom they have come into contact. No part of the history of civilization
offers a more hideous spectacle than that of colonization.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26863src" href="#xd31e26863">29</a> In the third place it is necessary to exclude peoples that have had much contact
with Europeans or other civilized peoples. In the fourth place we often lose sight
of the fact that primitive peoples show great differences of development, and consequently
cannot be placed in the same rank.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26880src" href="#xd31e26880">30</a> For example, if peoples despotically governed show strong egoistic tendencies, we
have no right to declare that all primitive peoples are egoistic.
</p>
<p>Finally it is of the highest importance in studying primitive peoples to make the
distinction between the acts which have to do with persons of the same social group,
and those which have to do with strangers. One of the principal causes of the charge
of egoism made against primitive peoples is to be found in the fact that this dualism
of ethics <span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span>is forgotten. In the passages I have cited (those from Maine and Steinmetz, for instance)
the great difference between acts committed within and without the group is brought
out. We have seen that the Indians of North America, although very altruistic toward
those who form the same group with them, as also toward their guests, are the most
pitiless enemies of those who attack their independence or their hunting ground. Now
it has been by these last acts that these peoples have been generally judged, a wholly
wrong method, since the “dualism of ethics” has always existed. Great would be the
astonishment if any one were to maintain that the South African war proved that the
English were a nation of murderers and incendiaries. Yet this is just the sort of
reasoning that is applied to primitive peoples.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26895src" href="#xd31e26895">31</a>

<p>How does it happen that some animal species are social while others are not? It is
impossible to maintain with some authors that sociability increases according to the
degree of development attained by the animal.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26923src" href="#xd31e26923">32</a> Certain insects, for example, are endowed with pronounced social feelings, while
the cat tribe and some kinds of birds are on the contrary unsocial. Nevertheless the
latter occupy a higher place in the scale than the former. The explanation, then,
must be sought elsewhere.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26935src" href="#xd31e26935">33</a>
</p>
<p>There are divers reasons that draw a more or less considerable number of animals to
one place—the fact of being born in the same locality, for example. Most animals are
social when they are young, even those which are no longer so when full-grown, like
the arachnids. Another cause that brings animals together is emigration towards a
country because of great changes of temperature. A third cause, probably the most
important, that unites animals of the same species is the abundance of the food-supply
of certain countries.
</p>
<p>However, the occasional assembling of animals does not explain why certain animals
are social while others are not. Lions, for example<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> often meet in places where they come to drink, and yet do not become social. It is
not probable that there are animals who have <i>remained</i> together because they have comprehended the advantages <span class="pageNum" id="pb393">[<a href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>of a life in common, for this would suppose an intelligence on their part which it
is difficult to attribute to them. In order that these animals should remain together
they must find it agreeable, and disagreeable to be isolated.
</p>
<p>When we study the social species of animals we notice that the life in common is in
general <i>one of their most powerful weapons in the struggle for existence</i>, a weapon without which it would be nearly or quite impossible for them to maintain
the fight. Consequently the animals for which the life in common is advantageous and
which possess social instincts stronger than others, have, when brought together by
any cause whatever, a greater chance to survive.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26957src" href="#xd31e26957">34</a> Per contra the animals who have to stalk their prey have more chance of surviving
when life in common is disagreeable to them. It is therefore by survival that social
feelings are developed in some species of animals and not in others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26962src" href="#xd31e26962">35</a> Habit, and the tendency to imitate increase these feelings considerably.
</p>
<p>The advantages to certain species of animals resulting from life in common are of
two kinds; in the first place a better defense against their enemies, and in the second
place greater ease in procuring subsistence. Wild cattle give us an example of the
first case; while the wolves who in winter gather into packs for purposes of the chase,
because food has become scarce, furnish us an example of the second. For other animals
(like the simians) social sentiments are helpful in both ways.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to amplify further upon the two ways in which life in groups is
of advantage to certain species of animals. We have yet to turn our attention to the
qualities developed by the group struggle for existence.
</p>
<p>One of the principal characteristics of social animals is the pleasure they experience
in living in common, so that a social animal is unhappy if he is separate from those
of the group in which he lives. Further it is necessary that the animal that cannot
live alone, and is happy with his group, should also feel a sympathy with that group.
Pleasure or its opposite felt by any individual reacts upon the whole group. A social
being will try then to favor the interests of his fellows as far as he can, and in
so far as he comprehends these interests. This sympathy will not extend to the whole
species but only to the group. <span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>The general interest of the group does not permit the sympathy to embrace the whole
species, but on the contrary requires one group to fight the other if, for example,
the latter interferes with its food-supply. And even within the limits of the group
the general interest may demand that a sick or wounded individual be abandoned, when
by its presence it would for example, attract beasts of prey, and thus put the existence
of all in danger.
</p>
<p>Highly developed sympathy produces the spirit of sacrifice, which impels the individual
to assist his companions sometimes even at the risk of his life.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26993src" href="#xd31e26993">36</a> This quality is reinforced by the desire of gaining the praise and avoiding the blame
of companions, which desire in its turn is brought about only by the life in common.
For the one that lives in conjunction with others, and takes pleasure in doing so,
whose interests are those of the members of the group, must be sensible of the approval
or disapproval of his acts felt by others, since their feelings of pleasure or displeasure
react upon himself. The lack of the power of speech among animals, however, limits
the force of praise or blame among them.
</p>
<p>We come now to the question: what are the causes of altruism among men?<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e26998src" href="#xd31e26998">37</a> It must be considered as certain that man has always lived in groups more or less
large, and it is even very probable that he is descended from animals equally social.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27006src" href="#xd31e27006">38</a> A study of the means man has of sustaining the struggle for existence proves that
they are of such a nature that he would have succumbed if he had lived in isolation.
Kautsky puts it thus: “… man … whose mightiest and most effective, almost whose only
weapon, indeed, in the struggle for existence, is association. He is, to be sure,
distinguished above other animals by his intelligence, but this too is to the fruit
of society, for in isolation he becomes dull and stupid. All man’s other weapons in
the struggle for existence are less efficient than those of the beasts. He has no
weapons of attack like the beasts of prey, nor is he protected by his size like the
elephant, hippopotamus and rhinoceros. He lacks the quickness of the squirrel and
deer, and cannot repair his losses through superabundant fertility.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27024src" href="#xd31e27024">39</a>
</p>
<p>It is therefore on account of his constitution and of the struggle <span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>that he has had to sustain for his existence that man is a social being; in other
words, those who showed social instincts stronger than the others ran less danger
of succumbing in the contest for life, and had more chance of transmitting their leanings
to their posterity. As man has greater intellectual capacities than the animals he
is more capable of understanding the joys and sorrows of his fellows, and so is better
able to assist the one and avoid the other. In the second place he has a developed
language at his command, through which a great influence can be exercised upon conduct
by blame and praise.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27034src" href="#xd31e27034">40</a>
</p>
<p>The fact that man is born with social instincts does not, however, explain altruism
sufficiently, for among animal species there is not one whose individuals have done
so much harm to one another as men, who, though they are social beings, are capable
of committing the most egoistic acts. How shall we explain these contradictions?
</p>
<p>We have seen above that primitive peoples, to whom we have referred showed very altruistic
traits of character. The members of a group extend mutual aid, and, in their relations
with one another, are benevolent, honest, truthful, and very susceptible to the opinions
of others,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27042src" href="#xd31e27042">41</a> etc.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to explain this either by the race to which these peoples belong
or by the climate in which they live, for they are of different races (for example
North American Indians and the Hindoos of the delta of the Ganges) and live under
different climates (as the Eskimos and the South American Indians). Besides this some
of these peoples show towards strangers, qualities directly contrary to those they
display toward members of their own group. Thus, as we have already remarked, the
North American Indians are most cruel enemies, most pitiless toward those who are
not of their group, while they are quite the reverse toward their own fellow-tribesmen.
It is plain, then, that their altruistic sentiments have nothing to do with race or
climate.
</p>
<p>Consequently the cause can only be found in the social environment, which is determined
in its turn by the mode of production. What follows will show that in the last instance
it is the mode of production that is able to develop the social predisposition innate
in man (not in the same measure for each individual, which is a question that I shall
return to) or prevent this disposition from being developed, or may even destroy it
entirely. Upon examining the modes of production in force among the peoples cited
we see that they are characterized <span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>by the following traits, very different from those of the present system.
</p>
<p>The first of these characteristic traits is this: <i>production takes place among these peoples for personal consumption and not for exchange
as with us</i>. It has often been claimed that the primitive peoples lived in a state of communism.
Taken in the sense of a communism in production this assertion is true only in part;
except for hunts undertaken in common, production was not carried on in common but
was individual. The weapons and utensils of the hunt were private property, while
the hunting-ground was held in common. Just so as soon as architectural technique
made some progress the houses often became common property. At its inception agriculture
was not practiced in common. It was only when it had attained a certain development
that this was sometimes the case.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27057src" href="#xd31e27057">42</a> But if we take communism in the sense of consumption in common, then the assertion
becomes much more exact. I do not mean to say that consumption always took place in
common<span></span> (though several primitive peoples took their food in common), but when from whatever
cause some members of the group had failed to produce, the other members who had been
more fortunate provided for them. The productivity of labor was still small; there
was not generally any surplus of labor. Even if there had been there could not have
been any possibility of exchange, since the division of labor was very slight, and
consequently each one was capable of making for himself what others would have been
able to offer in exchange.
</p>
<p>The second characteristic of the modes of production of the peoples in question is
bound up with the first, namely that <i>there was neither wealth nor poverty</i>. If there was privation (through scarcity of game, for example), all suffered; if
there was abundance, all profited by it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27070src" href="#xd31e27070">43</a>
</p>
<p>The third fact to be noted is that <i>the subordination of man to nature was very great</i>, so great that we, who have so largely subjugated the forces of nature, can have
no idea of it. If primitive men were very weak in their contest with nature even when
joined together in a single group, individually they were absolutely unable to maintain
the struggle, and were thus forced to unite.
</p>
<p>If we consider the characteristics of the primitive modes of production it becomes
clear, it seems to me, why the primitive peoples were not more egoistic. They had
neither rich nor poor; their economic <span class="pageNum" id="pb397">[<a href="#pb397">397</a>]</span>interests were either parallel or equal (the latter in the case of production in common);
the economic life, therefore, did not arouse egoistic ideas—they were not led into
temptation. Where the economic system does not produce egoistic ideas it accustoms
men to being unegoistic, and if their interests do happen occasionally to conflict,
the matter is looked at altruistically and not egoistically. And since the economic
life is the “<span lang="la">conditio sine qua non</span>” of life in general, and thus occupies the important place in human existence, it
stamps the whole life with its non-egoistic character. Since the struggle for existence
must be sustained in common against nature, if it is to be efficacious it binds human
interests so closely together that they are inseparable; the interest of one is the
same as that of his comrade.
</p>
<p>We shall now understand why primitive men feel themselves to be first of all the members
of a unit; why they not only abstain from acts harmful to their companions, but come
to their aid whenever they can; why they are honest, benevolent, and truthful towards
the members of their group, and why public opinion has so great an influence among
them—characteristics which the quotations that I have already made have established.
The cause of these facts is to be found in <i>the mode of production, which brought about a uniformity of interest in the persons
united in a single group, obliged them to aid one another in the difficult and uninterrupted
struggle for existence, and made men free and equal, since there was neither poverty
nor riches, and consequently no possibility of oppression</i>.
</p>
<p>It is only in such an environment that the social instincts innate in man can be developed,
and the more the mode of production binds men’s interests together the greater will
this development be. It is a truth as old as the world that one respects the interests
of others and does not deceive them, only when these others do not make life more
difficult, but aid in supporting it. If not, social instincts will be suppressed and
the contrary instincts formed. The development of the social feelings is based upon
reciprocity. When this is lacking these feelings lie dormant, but when reciprocity
exists they grow stronger by constantly reacting from one to the other.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27094src" href="#xd31e27094">44</a>
</p>
<p>There is still another reason which helped strengthen the solidarity among the members
of the same group. The primitive peoples, who practiced agriculture little or not
at all, needed an immense territory to provide for their needs. Lands whose population
would seem small to the Europeans of our day, had in reality as dense a population
as the mode of production would permit. From this there sprang <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>continual wars between groups disputing the possession of a certain territory. The
necessity of defending as a body the territory acquired, or of conquering it anew,
resulted in drawing always tighter the bonds uniting the members of the same group.
</p>
<p>The same mode of production which drew the members of a group into an altruistic solidarity,
forced these same persons into a position of excessive egoism toward those who did
not belong to their group and opposed them in obtaining what they needed. The same
act, killing an enemy for example, is the most egoistic act possible from the point
of view of the enemy but a very altruistic act from the point of view of the slayer,
since he has increased the security of his group. The development of the social feelings
is, then, only determined by the form of the struggle for existence.
</p>
<p>How then shall we explain certain egoistic acts directed against members of the same
group? How, for example, can the infanticide so common among primitive peoples be
explained? In seeking for a solution we shall see that this egoistic act does not
result from innate insensibility toward children (the contrary is true, as we have
seen above), but from the fact that the limited control over nature makes a great
increase in the population impossible. The children were killed immediately after
birth; no one dreamed of ridding himself of a child of greater age. Further, the nomadic
life prevented the carrying along of a great number of children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27109src" href="#xd31e27109">45</a>
</p>
<p>It is for the same reason that the sick and the aged were sometimes abandoned by the
primitive peoples. They were driven to this because these feeble persons were unable
to make long journeys, and because their economic means did not allow them to support
those who could no longer work. Here again there could be no question of innate insensibility.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27120src" href="#xd31e27120">46</a> In these cases then, there was an opposition of interests; the act that was egoistic
toward the individual was altruistic toward the group. If different action had been
taken in such cases all would have succumbed. Thus these acts have fallen into desuetude
as the productivity of labor has developed.
</p>
<p>The continual development of the productivity of labor has modified the structure
of society greatly. As soon as productivity has increased to such an extent that the
producer can regularly produce more than he needs, and the division of labor puts
him in a position to exchange the surplus for things that he could not produce himself,
at this moment there arises in man the notion of no longer giving to <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>his comrades what they need, but of keeping for himself the surplus of what his labor
produces, and exchanging it. Then it is that the mode of production begins to run
counter to the social instincts of man instead of favoring it as heretofore.
</p>
<p>In his work already quoted Nansen has described the influence exercised by exchange
upon the character of the Eskimos studied by him. (The fact that this commerce has
been developed by the coming of the Europeans makes no difference. Among primitive
peoples exchange must have developed in the same way, only more slowly.) He says:
“How baneful to them has been the introduction of money! Formerly they had no means
of saving up work or accumulating riches; for the products of their labor did not
last indefinitely, and therefore they gave away their superfluity. But then they learned
the use of money; so that now, when they have more than they need for the moment,
the temptation to sell the overplus to Europeans, instead of giving it to their needy
neighbors, is often too great for them; for with the money they thus acquire they
can supply themselves with the much coveted European commodities. Thus we Christians
help more and more to destroy instead of to develop their old self-sacrificing love
of their neighbors. And money does still more to undermine the Greenland community.
Their ideas of inheritance were formerly very vague, for, as before mentioned, the
clothes and weapons of a dead man were consigned with him to the grave. Now, on the
other hand, the introduction of money has enabled the survivors to sell the effects
of the deceased, and they are no longer ashamed to accept as an inheritance what they
can obtain in this way. This may seem an advantage; but, here, too, their old habit
of mind is upset. Greed and covetousness—vices which they formerly abhorred above
everything—have taken possession of them. Their minds are warped and enthralled by
money.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27134src" href="#xd31e27134">47</a> Thus are born avarice and rapacity, which, opposed in the beginning by altruistic
sentiments developed earlier, become stronger from one generation to another.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27137src" href="#xd31e27137">48</a>
</p>
<p>However, this is only one side of the question. Through the development of exchange
not only does man become egoistic towards those who for any reason are unable to provide
for their needs, but exchange itself is an entirely egoistic act for the two parties
who enter into it. Each tries to get as much profit for himself as possible, and consequently
to make the other lose. The existence of economic laws which in many, and even in
most cases prevent the two parties from injuring each other, does not change the fact
at all. Commerce <span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>weakens the social instincts of man; the loss of one becomes the gain of another.
When two persons are trading there springs up a tendency on the part of each to overvalue
his own property and to disparage that of the other; commerce is one of the important
causes of lying. In addition to this tendency another arises, that of giving goods
of quality inferior to that agreed upon; the constant attention to one’s own interests
produces and develops fraud.
</p>
<p>The more production for one’s own use decreases, and the greater becomes the production
for exchange, the more do habit and tradition produce in men the characteristics mentioned.
As soon as exchange has developed to a certain point commerce begins to be a special
trade. The merchant is much more exposed to the conditions named than those who trade
only occasionally. Not only does he pass a great part of his life in exchanging but
he is by profession egoistic in two directions; toward the producer from whom he buys,
and toward the consumer to whom he sells.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27148src" href="#xd31e27148">49</a>
</p>
<p>When it reaches a certain height the continually increasing productivity of labor
brings a further important modification in the social structure, namely slavery. For
this springs up when production is so advanced that man can regularly produce more
than he actually needs for himself, and when it is possible for him to exchange the
overplus for things which he can use but cannot make. Prisoners of war are no longer
killed as formerly, but are obliged to work for the profit of the conquerors. In this
way is formed a considerable opposition of interest between two classes of individuals
who together form a social unit: on the one hand those who, deprived of one of the
most important factors of human happiness, liberty, are obliged to exhaust themselves
for the benefit of others, and have only the strict necessaries of life; and on the
other hand those who profit by the enslavement and excessive labor of the first.
</p>
<p>Slavery (with the other forms of forced service, serfdom and wage-labor) is one of
the most important factors that undermine the social instincts in man. Slavery, runs
the saying, demoralizes the master as well as the slave. It arouses in the master
the notion that the slave is not a thinking and feeling man like himself, but an instrument
destined exclusively to be useful to him. In the slave himself it kills the feeling
of independence; lacking the arms which the free man has at his disposal, the slave
has recourse to dissimulation to defend himself against his master.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401">401</a>]</span></p>
<p>The overplus which one person can obtain by his own labor must always remain limited.
Without the rise of slavery the great wealth of a single individual would not have
been possible. To the difference between master and slave is now added that between
rich and poor, and the envy and hatred of the poor for the rich, and the pride of
the rich and their desire to dominate over the poor. Since the division of society
into rich and poor the aristocracy has been formed, which does not owe its origin
to the excellence of its members, as one might imagine from this inaccurate name,
but to their wealth.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The period of civilization during which the social modification mentioned above has
taken place is generally lauded to the skies, as compared with preceding epochs. In
certain relations this is justifiable. Technique has made immense progress and especially
during the last phase of civilization, capitalism; the power of man over nature has
advanced greatly; the productivity of labor has been so increased that one class of
men, exempted by this from permanent care for their daily bread, are able to devote
themselves to the arts and sciences. All this is indisputable. But the development
of the arts and sciences and of technique has only an indirect importance for the
etiology of crime. The question first of all to be asked is this: What influence has
this modification in the economic and social structure had upon the character of man?
And the answer to this question can only be the following: this modification has engendered
cupidity and ambition, has made man less sensitive to the happiness and misery of
his fellows, and has decreased the influence exercised upon men’s acts by the opinions
of others. In short, it has developed egoism at the expense of altruism.

<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.2.1.c">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">C.</span> <span class="sc">Egoistic Tendencies Resulting from the Present Economic System and from its Consequences.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The etiology of crime includes the three following problems:
</p>
<p>First. Whence does the criminal thought in man arise?
</p>
<p>Second. What forces are there in man which can prevent the execution of this criminal
thought, and what is their origin?
</p>
<p>Third. What is the occasion for the commission of criminal acts<span class="corr" id="xd31e27184" title="Source: .">?</span> (As the occasion may be one of the causes of the criminal thought, problems one and
three at times form but one.)
</p>
<p>For the moment we are still occupied with general considerations with regard to crime;
it is clear then that the first and third questions <span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span>will be examined only when we are treating of crimes according to the groups into
which they must be divided because of the great differences which their nature presents.
</p>
<p>It is otherwise with the second question. As we have seen in the preceding pages,
it is certain that man is born with social instincts, which, when influenced by a
favorable environment can exert a force great enough to prevent egoistic thoughts
from leading to egoistic acts. And since crime constitutes a part of the egoistic
acts, it is of importance, for the etiology of <i>crime in general</i>, to inquire whether the present method of production and its social consequences
are an obstacle to the development of the social instincts, and in what measure. We
shall try in the following pages to show the influence of the economic system and
of these consequences upon the social instincts of man.
</p>
<p>After what we have just said it is almost superfluous to remark that the <span class="corr" id="xd31e27197" title="Source: egotisic">egoistic</span> tendency does not <i>by itself</i> make a man criminal. For this something else is necessary. It is possible for the
environment to create a great egoist, but this does not imply that the egoist will
necessarily become criminal. For example, a man who is enriched by the exploitation
of children may nevertheless remain all his life an honest man from the legal point
of view. He does not think of stealing, because he has a surer and more lucrative
means of getting wealth, although he lacks the moral sense which would prevent him
from committing a crime if the thought of it occurred to him. We shall show that,
as a consequence of the present environment, man has become very egoistic and hence
more <i>capable of crime</i>, than if the environment had developed the germs of altruism.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.a"><i>a. The present economic system</i> is based upon exchange. As we saw at the end of the preceding section such a mode
of production cannot fail to have an egoistic character. A society based upon exchange
isolates the individuals by weakening the bond that unites them. When it is a question
of exchange the two parties interested think only of their own advantage even to the
detriment of the other party. In the second place the possibility of exchange arouses
in a man the thought of the possibility of converting the surplus of his labor into
things which increase his well-being in place of giving the benefit of it to those
who are deprived of the necessaries of life. Hence the possibility of exchange gives
birth to cupidity.
</p>
<p>The exchange called simple circulation of commodities is practiced by all men as consumers,
and by the workers besides as vendors of their labor power. However, the influence
of this simple circulation of commodities is weak compared with that exercised by
capitalistic <span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span>exchange. It is only the exchange of the surplus of labor, by the producer, for other
commodities, and hence is for him a secondary matter. As a result he does not exchange
with a view to profit, (though he tries to make as advantageous a trade as possible)
but to get things which he cannot produce himself.
</p>
<p>Capitalistic exchange, on the other hand, has another aim—that of making a profit.
A merchant, for example, does not buy goods for his own use, but to sell them to advantage.
He will, then, always try, on the one hand, to buy the best commodities as cheaply
as possible, by depreciating them as much as he can; on the other hand, to make the
purchaser pay as high a price as possible, by exaggerating the value of his wares.
<i>By the nature of the mode of production itself</i> the merchant is therefore forced to make war upon two sides, must maintain his own
interests against the interests of those with whom he does business. If he does not
injure too greatly the interests of those from whom he buys, and those to whom he
sells, it is for the simple reason that these would otherwise do business with those
of his competitors who do not find their interest in fleecing their customers. Wherever
competition is eliminated for whatever cause the tactics of the merchant are shown
in their true light; he thinks only of his own advantage even to the detriment of
those with whom he does business. “No commerce without trickery” is a proverbial expression
(among consumers), and with the ancients Mercury, the god of commerce, was also the
god of thieves. This is true, that the merchant and the thief are alike in taking
account <i>exclusively</i> of their own interest to the detriment of those with whom they have to do.
</p>
<p>The fact that in our present society production does not take place generally to provide
for the needs of men, but for many other reasons, has important effects upon the character
of those who possess the means of production. Production is carried on for profit
exclusively; if greater profits can be made by stopping production it will be stopped—this
is the point of view of the capitalists. The consumers, on the other hand, see in
production the means of creating what man has need of. The world likes to be deceived,
and does not care to recognize the fact that the producer has only his own profit
in view. The latter encourages this notion and poses as a disinterested person. If
he reduces the price of his wares, he claims to do it in the interest of the public,
and takes care not to admit that it is for the purpose of increasing his own profits.
This is the falsity that belongs inevitably to capitalism.
</p>
<p>In general this characteristic of capitalism has no importance for <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>the morality of the consumer, who is merely duped, but it is far otherwise with the
press, which is almost entirely in the power of the capitalists. The press, which
ought to be a guide for the masses, and is so in some few cases, in the main is in
the hands of capitalists who use it only as a means of making money. In place of being
edited by men who, by their ability and firmness, are capable of enlightening the
public, newspapers are carried on by persons who see in their calling only a livelihood,
and consider only the proprietor of the sheet. In great part the press is the opposite
of what it ought to be; it represents the interests of those who pay for advertisements
or for articles; it increases the ignorance and the prejudices of the crowd; in a
word, it poisons public opinion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27223src" href="#xd31e27223">50</a>
</p>
<p>Besides this general influence upon the public the press has further a special place
in the etiology of crime, from the fact that most newspapers, in order to satisfy
the morbid curiosity of the public, relate all great crimes <span lang="la">in extenso</span>, give portraits of the victims, etc., and are often one of the causes of new crimes,
by arousing the imitative instinct to be found in man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27260src" href="#xd31e27260">51</a>
</p>
<p>As we have seen above the merchant capitalist makes war in two directions; his interests
are against those of the man who sells to him, and of the man who buys from him. This
is also true of the industrial capitalist. He buys raw materials and sells what he
produces. But to arrive at his product he must buy labor, and this purchase is “<span lang="la">sui generis</span>.”
</p>
<p>Deprived as he is of the means of production the working-man sells <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>his labor only in order not to die of hunger. The capitalist takes advantage of this
necessitous condition of the worker and exploits him. We have already indicated that
capitalism has this trait in common with the earlier methods of production. Little
by little one class of men has become accustomed to think that the others are destined
to amass wealth for them and to be subservient to them in every way. Slavery, like
the wage system, demoralizes the servant as well as the master. With the master it
develops cupidity and the imperious character which sees in a fellow man only a being
fit to satisfy his desires. It is true that the capitalist has not the power over
the proletarian that the master has over his slave; he has neither the right of service
nor the power of life and death, yet it is none the less true that he has another
weapon against the proletarian, a weapon whose effect is no less terrible, namely
enforced idleness. The fact that the supply of manual labor always greatly exceeds
the demand puts this weapon into the hands of every capitalist. It is not only the
capitalists who carry on any business that are subjected to this influence, but also
all who are salaried in their service.
</p>
<p>Capitalism exercises in still a third manner an egoistic influence upon the capitalistic
“entrepreneur.” Each branch has more producers than are necessary. The interests of
the capitalists are, then, opposed not only to those of the men from whom they buy
or to whom they sell, but also to those of their fellow producers. It is indeed claimed
that competition has the effect simply of making the product better and cheaper, but
this is looking at the question from only one point of view. The fact which alone
affects criminality is that competition forces the participants, under penalty of
succumbing, to be as egoistic as possible. Even the producers who have the means of
applying all the technical improvements to perfect their product and make it cheaper,
are obliged to have recourse to gross deceits in advertising, etc., in order to injure
their competitors. Rejoicing at the evil which befalls another, envy at his good fortune,
these forms of egoism are the inevitable consequence of competition.
</p>
<p>Following the same classification that we employed in the preceding chapter we come
now to that part of the bourgeoisie which, without having any occupation, consumes
what has been made by others. Not to feel obliged to contribute to the material well-being
of humanity in proportion to one’s ability must necessarily have a demoralizing influence.
A parasite, one who lives without working, does not feel bound by any moral tie to
his fellows, but regards them simply as things, instruments meant to serve and amuse
him. Their example is <span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>a source of demoralization for those about them, and excites the envy of those who
see this easy life without the power of enjoying it themselves, and awakes in them
the desire to exchange their painful existence for this “<span lang="it">dolce far niente</span>.”
</p>
<p>The egoistic tendencies work less strongly in the third group of the bourgeoisie,
those who practice the liberal professions. However, the products of the arts and
sciences having become commodities, the egoistic influence of exchange here too is
not to be neglected. Then competition arising from overproduction is a great cause
of demoralization, for where there is competition men become egoistic. So in the domain
of the liberal professions competition often forces those who do not find a field
of activity in accordance with their ideas, to work that is contrary to those ideas.
Thus it is quite right to speak of a prostitution of the intellect.
</p>
<p>Before concluding these observations upon the bourgeoisie there is still something
to be said about politics. As we have seen above the state owes its origin to the
formation of opposition of interests in society; the first task of the state being,
therefore, the maintenance of a certain amount of order. This requires above all the
holding of the great mass in subjection. As long as this mass is weak the dominant
class has no need to resort to trickery; but as soon as the oppressed class can oppose
the domination of the others, as soon as brutal power no longer gives the desired
result, the dominant class changes its tactics. It attempts to create the impression
that the concessions it has been forced to make are acts of charity; and presuming
upon the ignorance of the oppressed, it pretends that their condition is not so bad,
etc. Many of those engaged in politics play this part without being conscious of their
duplicity. However, the contest between the classes exercises its baleful influence
upon them also, for they involuntarily distort the facts, whereas the evolution of
society has reached such a point that a new social order is necessary.
</p>
<p>The power in the State sometimes passes from one party of the ruling class to another.
All profit by the temporary opportunity not only for the realization of their political
program, but also to procure advantages for their partisans. This struggle for power
is carried on partly by means prejudicial to the character of those interested, while
the end aimed at by some parties can be frankly avowed. It is for the same reason
that international politics is such a source of lying and hypocrisy, the states not
being able to avow their real intention—the weakening of their neighbors.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>The proletariat.</i> To be thorough we begin by making mention of one of the consequences of the economic
position of the proletariat, of which we have already treated briefly, namely the
dependence in which persons of this class find themselves in consequence of their
lacking the means of production, a state which has a prejudicial influence upon character.
The oppressed resort to means which they would otherwise scorn. As we have seen above,
the basis of the social feelings is reciprocity. As soon as this is trodden under
foot by the ruling class the social sentiments of the oppressed become weak towards
them.
</p>
<p>We come now (following the order adopted in the first chapter of Part II) first to
the consequences of the labor of the young. The paid labor of the young has a bad
influence in several ways. First, it forces them, while they are still very young,
to think only of their own interests; then, brought into contact with persons who
are rough and indifferent to their well-being, they follow these only too quickly,
because of their imitative tendencies, in their bad habits, grossness of speech, etc.
Finally, the paid labor of the young makes them more or less independent at an age
where they have the greatest need of guidance. Even if the statistical proof of the
influence of the labor of children and young people upon criminality were totally
wanting, no one could deny that influence. Child labor is entirely a capitalistic
phenomenon, being found especially in the great manufacturing countries like England
and Germany. And then one of the most salient facts of criminality is the amount of
juvenile crime, which is so enormous that England, followed by other countries, has
established a special system to combat this form of criminality. Certainly this increase
of juvenile crime is chiefly due to the influence of bad domestic conditions (wage-labor
of married women, etc.), but the labor of the young people themselves also plays its
part.
</p>
<p>Although figures upon the relation in question are not totally lacking, they are,
as far as I know, quite rare. In the first part of this work I have given the figures
furnished by P. Hirsch, to which I refer the reader.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27372src" href="#xd31e27372">52</a> The director of the “<span lang="de">Erziehungsheim am Urban</span>” at Zehlendorf near Berlin, mentions that 80% of his pupils had formerly practiced

<p>These figures are very significant. Among the young delinquents there are two or three
times as many persons following a trade as among non-delinquents.
</p>
<p>I do not know of any other statistics giving information upon this point directly.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27501src" href="#xd31e27501">56</a>
</p>
<p>As to statics (the geography of crime) we encounter great difficulties of a technical
nature. The statistics in which we can compare juvenile delinquency with the local
extent of child labor are rare, often taking no account of the figures for the non-criminal
population.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27520src" href="#xd31e27520">57</a> On this point the statistics of Germany, Italy, and Austria are the best.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27534src" href="#xd31e27534">58</a>
</p>
<p>Since the work of young people has increased enormously, and in general is still increasing,
we may expect an increase in juvenile crime also, unless there are other determining
factors, such as special laws, which work in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>In order to give an example of the extent of child labor we take from one of the best
sets of statistics of occupations the following figures.
</p>
<p>In the census of occupations in the German Empire in 1895 it was shown that whereas
in 1882 16.46% of the population under 20 had some occupation (other than that of
domestic servant), in 1895 there were 17.97% so employed, an increase of 9.1%.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27557src" href="#xd31e27557">59</a> The absolute figures are the following. In 1882 the number of persons below the <span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>age of 20 at work was 3,333,791; in 1895 it was 4,161,600, an increase of 827,809.
</p>
<p>In 1895 the number of persons at work below the age of 20 was divided among the different
ages as follows:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e27570src" href="#xd31e27570">60</a>

<p>If we remember that in 1890 persons from 12 to 18 years of age formed 12.75% of the
population,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e28669src" href="#xd31e28669">64</a> the study of this table will show how large a part the young play in certain crimes,
and in crime in general. Still it must not be forgotten that criminal statistics include
only a part of the crimes really committed, and that this affects particularly the
figures for juvenile crime, since the persons injured make complaint against the young
less readily, on account of pity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e28675src" href="#xd31e28675">65</a>
</p>
<p>According to the figures given below (which, it is true, only cover a short period)
juvenile delinquency in England has remained almost stationary.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e28681src" href="#xd31e28681">66</a> Here we must remember: first, the great number of acquittals; second, that the criminality
of the young is nowhere <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>better combated than in England with its system of Industrial and Reformatory Schools;
third, that industrialism has been prevalent in England longer than elsewhere, and
that the increase of criminality during the period designated cannot be as great as
in other less industrial countries.

<p>Consequently there is here, too, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to adult
crime, an increase in juvenile criminality (about 23% in 18 years). Estimates of the
number of non-criminal minors are wanting to give us a complete picture. It must not
be forgotten that Austrian law ranks simple theft, fraud, assault, and the like as
“contraventions”, and that these do not figure in these statistics. The total figures
for young criminals are consequently much higher.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e29313src" href="#xd31e29313">71</a>

<p>Here, then, we have once more a slight diminution in juvenile criminality, but less
great than that of criminality in general.
</p>
<p>We should deceive ourselves if we saw in these figures the conclusive <span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>proof that criminality on the part of the young was decreasing. We must not overlook
the fact that these figures do not include those delinquents whose prosecution was
not pushed, whether because they were thought not to have understood the nature of
their acts, or because the offense was considered as too light. It is well known that
judges incline more and more to the opinion that it is better not to convict youthful
delinquents, but to send them to a house of correction, or to place them under the
care of a guardian.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e30066src" href="#xd31e30066">76</a> What the figures given above show is that the increase of juvenile criminality has
not been as great in France as it has been in Germany. (I have not the figures for
child labor in France, but probably the increase is not as great as it has been in
Germany, which is more of an industrial country. The difference, then, in the juvenile
crime of the two countries would be explained, at least in part.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e30085src" href="#xd31e30085">77</a>

<p>Juvenile criminality has not changed much, then, as compared with the criminality
of adults. As I have already observed above, there is reason to suppose that the real
facts are different, especially after <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>1905, when the new law with regard to juvenile crime was put into effect.

<p>Keeping constantly in mind that in our days juvenile criminals are less often sentenced
than formerly, we shall find that the foregoing statistics show:
</p>
<p>First. That juvenile crime is increasing.
</p>
<p>Second. That this increase is considerable in the countries like Germany, Austria,
and Belgium, where there is a continuous industrial development; while in countries
less developed industrially the increase is less.
</p>
<p>Third. That England, where the capitalism is very intense, shows a great amount of
juvenile crime.
</p>
<p>The figures we have given have in general, in my opinion, gone to support the incontestable
truth, that there is a relation between child labor and juvenile criminality. Although
it is of smaller importance than the lack of care of the children among the proletariat,
it is still one of the factors in the etiology of crime.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31057src" href="#xd31e31057">86</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb420a">[<a href="#pb420a">420</a>]</span></p>
<p>Following the order adopted in Part II, chapter I, we come now to the influence of
long hours of labor. It has rightly been said that work has a strong moral influence.
But it is also true that immoderate labor has the contrary effect. It brutalizes a
man, makes him incapable of elevated sentiments, kills as Key says (in “<span lang="de">das Jahrhundert des Kindes</span>”), the man in the beast, while moderate labor ennobles the beast in the man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31180src" href="#xd31e31180">87</a>
</p>
<p>The housing conditions of the proletariat have also a significance as regards criminality,
and for the special group of sexual offenses their importance is very great. We shall
speak of this more fully when we treat especially of these offenses, and will, for
the moment, note simply their general consequences.
</p>
<p>The disorder and squalor of the home communicate themselves to the inmates; the lack
of room obliges the children to live, during a great part of the day, on the streets,
with the result that they are brought into contact with all sorts of demoralizing
companions. Finally, the living together of a great number of uneducated persons in
one small dwelling is the cause of constant quarrels and fights. The situation of
those who are merely night-lodgers is especially unfortunate, as we have already seen.
</p>
<p>In Part I we have quoted from authors who have laid stress upon the importance of
the question of housing conditions in the study of criminality (Hirsch, for example),
and we have indicated the gravity of this cause in speaking of prostitution and alcoholism.
</p>
<p>It would be possible to quote a number of authors who have taken up the effect of
housing conditions upon morals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31191src" href="#xd31e31191">88</a> However, it is naturally very difficult to express this influence in figures. As
far <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>as I know it is Dr. E. Laspeyres who (in “<span lang="de">Der <span class="corr" id="xd31e31281" title="Source: Einflusz">Einfluss</span> der Wohnung auf die Sittlichkeit</span>”) gives the most significant data upon this subject. I borrow from him the following
figures: summarizing part of the results of a study of “Furnished Rooms” in 2,360
dwellings:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31285src" href="#xd31e31285">89</a>

<p>Although the division according to good and bad conduct is somewhat arbitrary, and
although it is impossible to separate the effect of bad housing from other influences
operative at the same time, yet these figures say plainly: there is a relationship
between housing and conduct. It is evident that there is a reciprocal effect between
the condition of the dwelling and the conduct of the inmates, but this fact does not
diminish the influence of the dwelling.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31659src" href="#xd31e31659">92</a>

<p>The evil influence of living in furnished rooms comes out plainly in these figures.
</p>
<p>As has already been said at the beginning of these observations as to the influence
of the economic life upon the development of social feelings on the part of the proletariat,
the egoistic side of the human character is developed by the fact that the individual
is dependent, that he lives in a subordinate position, and that he feels himself poor
and deprived of everything. However, in so far as the proletarian sells his labor
he is guaranteed against famine, however miserable his condition, and conscious of
the utility of his rôle in society, he feels himself, notwithstanding his poverty,
a man who, except for his employer, is independent of all men. But if work is not
to be found, or if the proletarian, sick and infirm, is not able to work, it goes
without saying that the resulting unemployment is very demoralizing. The lack of steady
work, the horrors of the penury into which he and his fall, and the long train of
evils which result from both, kill the social feelings in a man, for, as we have seen
above, these feelings depend upon reciprocity. Let one familiarize himself with the
thought of <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>the condition of the man who lives in the greatest poverty, <i>i.e.</i> the man who is abandoned by all, and he will understand how egoistic must be the
feelings of such.
</p>
<p>From the position in which the proletarians find themselves it follows that, towards
each other, it is rather the altruistic than the egoistic feelings that develop; living
less isolated than the bourgeois, they see the misfortune that strikes their neighbor,
and have felt the same themselves, and above all, their economic interests are not
opposed. Forced idleness—at present chronic, and acute in times of panic—modifies
these conditions at times; it makes competitors of the workers, who take the bread
out of each other’s mouths.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31883src" href="#xd31e31883">94</a>
</p>
<p>The proletarian is never sure of his existence: like the sword of Damocles unemployment
is constantly hanging over his head. Upon this subject Engels says:
</p>
<p>“But far more demoralizing than his poverty in its influence upon the English working
man is the insecurity of his position, the necessity of living upon wages from hand
to mouth, that in short which makes a proletarian of him. The smaller peasants in
Germany are usually poor, and often suffer want, but they are less at the mercy of
accident, they have at least something secure. The proletarian, who has nothing but
his two hands, who consumes today what he earned yesterday, who is subject to every
chance, and has not the slightest guarantee for being able to earn the barest necessities
of life, whom every crisis, every whim of his employer may deprive of bread, this
proletarian is placed in the most revolting, inhuman position conceivable for a human
being.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31892src" href="#xd31e31892">95</a>
</p>
<p>This uncertainty of existence is one of the reasons which explain why, in relatively
prosperous times the <span class="corr" id="xd31e31898" title="Source: workingman">working-man</span> often spends his wages as soon as he receives them, for he knows that the economies
possible to him are so small that he could never be saved from misery in case of unemployment.
</p>
<p>Finally we must speak of ignorance and lack of training on the part of the proletariat,
as a factor of criminality. As we know, this question of education is one of those
which are most debated in criminal sociology. Certain authors have prophesied that
each new school would make a prison superfluous, while on the other hand it has been
claimed that ignorance and the lack of civilization have nothing to do with the etiology
of crime, but that on the contrary knowledge and civilization are even factors of
crime. Although these extreme <span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>opinions are hardly ever expressed nowadays, the ideas upon the point in question
still differ widely.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e31905src" href="#xd31e31905">96</a>
</p>
<p>In my opinion, no really decisive arguments have ever been adduced for the opinion
that the intellectual condition of men has no influence upon criminality. In general
the reasoning is as follows: ignorance is decreasing; crime on the contrary increases;
ignorance cannot therefore be a factor. Such a line of argument is very superficial,
for ignorance is surely not the only cause of crime. Its influence may therefore be
neutralized by other factors. And further, from the point of view of statistics it
is not permissible to use the indirect method when the direct method is practicable.
In most criminal and prison statistics the percentage of the illiterate among the
criminals is given, and we have only to put beside these figures those for the illiterate
among the non-criminal population to be convinced of the existence or absence of the
connection in dispute.
</p>
<p>We shall begin, then, by giving the figures that we know.

<p>The redactor of the official statistics of Switzerland observes that there are no
figures to determine the number of illiterates among the non-criminal population,
but the statistics of recruits for the years 1891 to 1895 show that about 19% of the
recruits had a higher education.
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the statistics which I have quoted,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e34849src" href="#xd31e34849">118</a> including, as they do, millions of criminals, are very significant: the illiterates
supply, in general, a great proportion of the criminals, a proportion much greater
than that of the illiterates in the general population. (In countries with a relatively
small number of illiterates, like England, the Netherlands, and Prussia, for example,
the difference is naturally much greater than in a country like Italy where the percentage
of illiteracy is great. In Prussia for instance, there are <span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>thirty-six times as many illiterates among the recidivists as among the recruits.)
</p>
<p>However, most of the statistics, aside from the figures for illiteracy, give others
which show how many persons really educated are to be found among the criminals. And
then we note that a very great majority of criminals are ignorant and untrained. In
England, for example, there is among male criminals only 1 to 1,000 who knows more
than how to read and write well, and among the women not even 1 to 1,000; in Austria
there are a little more than 4 to 1,000; and in France a little more than 20 to 1,000
among the men, and between 4 and 5 among the women. The relation between ignorance
and criminality cannot, then, be contradicted. But it is impossible to fix exactly
the extent of the influence of the one upon the other, or it is difficult to separate
ignorance from other factors with which it is ordinarily found, as poverty, for instance.
</p>
<p>The ancient idea that crime is only a consequence of ignorance need not be treated
of, for morality and intellect are two distinct parts of the psychic life, even though
there exists a certain relation between them.
</p>
<p>The first reason why ignorance and the lack of general culture must be ranked among
the general factors of crime is this: the person who, in our present society, where
the great majority of parents care very little for the education of their children,
does not go to school, is deprived of the moral ideas (honesty, etc.) which are taught
there, and ordinarily passes his time in idleness and vagabondage.
</p>
<p>The second reason which makes ignorance a factor of crime, is that generally an ignorant
man is, more than others, a man moved by the impulse of the moment, who allows himself
to be governed by his passions, and is induced to commit acts which he would not have
committed if his intellectual equipment had been different.
</p>
<p>In the third place, it is for the following reasons that ignorance and the lack of
training fall within the etiology of crime. The mind of the man whose psychic qualities,
whether in the domain of the arts, or of the sciences, have been developed, has become
less susceptible to evil ideas. His intellectual condition constitutes thus a bridle
which can restrain evil thoughts from realizing themselves; for real art and true
science strengthen the social instincts. The figures cited above furnish only a slight
contribution to this question. There is no doubt that if we had figures showing how
many criminals there are any part of whose life is taken up by art or science, we
should find the number very small. It could not be objected that the cause of this
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span>in the innate qualities of the criminals; certainly one man is born with greater capacity
than another, but everyone is born with some capacities which, if developed, may become
a source of happiness; and a happy man, says the proverb, is not wicked.
</p>
<p>Finally ignorance is in still another way a factor in crime. Very often the author
of a crime conceives and executes it in so clumsy a fashion and with so little chance
of success, that we may be certain that he would not have committed it if he had not
been an ignorant person, without knowledge of the forces with which he had to do.
</p>
<p>When the Italian school is reproached with making their researches upon prisoners
only, and not upon criminals and their free equals, the implication is that it is
only the stupid and ignorant criminals that are in prison, while the others, the shrewd
and tricky, remain at liberty. There is assuredly much truth in this assertion.
</p>
<p><i>The lower proletariat.</i> In the preceding pages I have already spoken of the influence exercised by bad material
surroundings upon a man’s character; I have pointed out the moral consequences of
bad housing conditions, and also that he becomes embittered and malicious through
lack of the necessaries of life. All this applies to the proletariat in general, but
much more strongly still to those who do not succeed, for any reason, in selling their
labor, that is the lower proletariat.
</p>
<p>If the dwellings of the working-class are bad, those of the lower proletariat are
more pitiable still. There are, through sickness or lack of work, periods of dire
poverty in the life of almost every worker—for the lower proletariat these periods
are without intermission. Its poverty is chronic. And when the poverty makes itself
felt for a long time together, the intellectual faculties become blunted to such a
point that there remains of the man only the brute, struggling for existence.
</p>
<p>Although the material and intellectual poverty of the lower proletariat is much greater
than that of the proletariat, the difference between them is only quantitative. In
one connection, however, there is also a qualitative difference, and a very important
one, namely that the working-man is a useful being without whom society could not
exist. However oppressed he may be, he is a man who has a feeling of self-respect.
It is different with the member of the lower proletariat. He is not useful, but a
detriment. He produces nothing, and tries to live upon what others make; he is merely
tolerated. He who has lived long in poverty loses all feeling of self-respect, and
lends himself to anything whatever that will suffice to prolong his existence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>In short, poverty (taken in the sense of absolute want), kills the social sentiments
in man, destroys in fact all relations between men. He who is abandoned by all can
no longer have any feeling for those who have left him to his fate.
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.b"><i>b. The proportion in which the different classes are guilty of crime.</i> After having treated of the direct consequences of the present economic system upon
the different classes, I shall take up this question, which is an important one for
the problem of criminality, before touching upon the indirect consequences.
</p>
<p>As I have already observed in Part I, the opinions with regard to this proportion
are very divergent. There are authors (Garofalo, for instance) who are of the opinion
that the bourgeoisie commits as many crimes, in proportion to its numbers, as the
proletariat. On the other hand there are those who maintain that the prisons hold
only the poor. That Garofalo’s conclusion does not hold good for Italy has been proved
by the statistics of Fornasari di Verce and those of Dr. Marro, quoted in Part I of
this book. The figures given by Fornasari di Verce have to do with the persons sentenced
by the assizes, the correctional tribunals, and the justices of the peace. They show
that 56% of the convicts were indigent, that 31% had only the strict necessities of
life, 10% were moderately well off, while 2% were well-to-do or rich; while among
the non-criminal population about 40% were rich or more or less well-to-do, and the
other 60% indigent or having only the necessaries of life. But the figures for non-possessors
become much greater if we take only the number of those sentenced by the court of
assizes,—the real criminals.

<p>Italy not being a rich country, it is evident that the headings “passably well-off”
and “well-to-do or rich” have been given a liberal interpretation, otherwise they
would never include almost 40% of the population. But even taking account of this
fact, these figures show that the indigent, that is, the lower proletariat, and the
proletariat without work, form a much higher proportion of the criminal class than
of the population as a whole.
</p>
<p>Other figures confirming these conclusions for Italy have been produced by Dr. Colajanni
(see Part I of this work). Further than these, statistics concerning the financial
condition of convicts are not numerous so far as I know. Here are those that are known
to me:

<p>I have not been able to procure the figures showing the financial condition of the
Austrian population. But it may be considered as certain that there are more well-to-do
persons in Austria than about 3% of the population, and also that there are more persons
with a little money than the percentage of criminals shown under that <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>heading. Therefore, as in Italy, the poor there are more guilty of crime than the
well-to-do (and much more so of certain crimes). It is interesting to note that well-to-do
women are not guilty at all of most crimes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e35432src" href="#xd31e35432">124</a>

<p>There were no rich persons then among the recidivists; no one with an income of more
than 5,000 marks. On the other hand, those of very limited income are exceedingly
numerous, especially among the women. It is a pity that the first group was not further
subdivided, for “less than 900 marks” leaves the group still very large.

<p>All the statistics cited<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e35663src" href="#xd31e35663">127</a> show then that the poor supply a very great proportion of the convicts, in every
case a greater proportion than they bear to the population in general, and the well-to-do
form only a small part.
</p>
<p>There are still other ways of inquiring what part the different classes take in criminality.
One consists in an examination of the statistics of the intellectual development of
the convicts, for the illiterate and those who have received only a primary education
belong, almost without exception, to the classes without fortune. These statistics
have already been given, and they confirm entirely the conclusions to be drawn from
the figures for the financial condition of the convicts.
</p>
<p>The third way of solving the problem is by a study of the statistics of the occupations
of those convicted. Here, however, great difficulties present themselves. In the first
place not all the criminal statistics make the distinction between the employer and
the workman in such and such an occupation. And it is just this information that we
need. In the second place we need beside statistics for the occupation of the criminals,
others showing the occupations of the population in general, and the two classified
in the same way. Even in this case the picture given by these statistics will not
be exact, for there are among the employers many persons who are not really independent
(workers at home, etc.), or persons who, while being employers, are, as far as their
plane of living is concerned, only the equal of the proletarian, and not of the bourgeois.
</p>
<p>Upon this question we have the following figures:

<p>These statistics, probably the best upon the subject, tell the whole story to those
who know how to read the figures. They constitute a proof of the enormous influence
of the social factors in the etiology of crime. It is impossible to maintain that
the influence works the other way, that the moral disposition influences the choice
of a profession. Dr. Prinzing rightly says in the article cited: “It is quite impossible
that those engaged in the three great groups of occupations, agriculture, manufacturing,
and commerce, are persons of different kinds of moral traits. On the contrary, the
supposition that the moral endowment of each group is nearly the same is completely
justified by the movements that are continually going on under our own eyes, through
which the countryman becomes a city-dweller, and the man who has grown up in the practice
of agriculture, a workman or assistant in manufacturing and commerce.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e36621src" href="#xd31e36621">132</a>

<p>According to the first table the workmen are implicated, in a much greater degree
than the independents, in all the crimes except that of <span class="pageNum" id="pb444">[<a href="#pb444">444</a>]</span>insult (which is explained by the fact that this crime is one of those which are prosecuted
only after complaint laid, and that working-men decide to lay complaint much less
quickly than the bourgeois). Certain crimes, indeed, are more often committed by the
independent merchants than by the <span class="corr" id="xd31e37187" title="Source: workingmen">working-men</span> of the same class, but here it is necessary to remember that many of the small merchants
are on the same plane of living as the working-men. The liberal professions, on the
contrary, show very low figures, a fact which is to be plainly noticed in the second
table, where the attention is caught by the very low figures of the group of students
and person with incomes. The participation in all crimes by unskilled workmen is very
great, even if we allow for the figures’ being exaggerated.
</p>
<p>I have not been able to procure statistics concerning the occupations of the whole
population of England. Nevertheless, it seems to me to be worth while to mention the
figures concerning the occupations of the criminals, for, considered by themselves,
they show clearly that the classes without means play a very large part in crime.
At least 95% of the men are in this condition, as well as at least 5% of the women
(a part of the merchants must be added in both cases) while of the 31.9% without occupation
it is certain that a large number are also poor.

<p>Since this table makes no distinction between independents and dependents, it does
not advance the matter much, and the only important observation that can be drawn
from it is that agriculture and the liberal professions give the lowest figures. A
clearer idea is given by the following table:

<p>Although there are no statistics of the occupations of the corresponding non-criminal
population, the figures are well worth noting. We discover that the unskilled laborers
form a large proportion of the prisoners, in every case a larger proportion than they
bear to the population in general; and that the merchants and manufacturers form a
much smaller part of the prisoners than they do of the population as a whole, for
they certainly constitute more than 5.45%, especially in France, a country where small
industries still flourish.

<p>We have now arrived at the end of our observations upon occupations among criminals.
Other statistics are available, but either it is impossible to compare them with statistics
of the non-criminal population, or they are without significance for some other reason.
At any rate it seems to me that those I have given are enough to show that proportionately
the non-possessors are more guilty of crime than the possessors.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e37910src" href="#xd31e37910">141</a>
</p>
<p>The thesis set forth above is confirmed, then, in three different ways. <span class="pageNum" id="pb448">[<a href="#pb448">448</a>]</span>The question still remains to be answered, to what must we attribute the greater criminality
among the non-possessors?
</p>
<p>As was remarked at the beginning of this section (on the egoistic tendency of the
present economic system, and its consequences), there are three questions which present
themselves in connection with the etiology of crime; first, what is the origin of
the criminal idea? Second, what are the forces in man which prevent this idea from
coming to realization? Third, the occasion for committing the crime. For the moment
we shall concern ourselves with the second question only; and we shall ask ourselves
the question, is the explanation that these forces are weaker with non-possessors
than with others? It is very difficult, if not impossible, to give an answer to this
question, for it is very complicated. In the first place it is necessary to prove
that the environment of the non-possessors arouses thoughts for which that of the
possessors offers no place. The circumstances in which the well-to-do live are in
general of such a nature that the moral force has no need of offering combat, since
the criminal thought does not exist. For example, in economic offenses one of the
principal provocatives of criminal ideas is poverty, which is unknown to the bourgeoisie.
It follows that nothing definite can be said about the relative force of the moral
sentiments in these two groups of the population in counteracting criminal ideas.
Other examples could be added, and I am of the opinion that this influence of the
environment will be by itself sufficient to explain the difference in the criminality
of the two groups.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to decide with certainty whether, aside from the above-mentioned
influence of the environment, the present economic system and its consequences have
a harmful influence upon the social sentiments that is stronger in the case of non-possessors
than it is in the case of possessors. It must be considered as certain (and the figures
which I shall give farther along also show it) that the circumstances in which children
and young people live among the proletariat is a cause of their being much more demoralized
than the children of the bourgeoisie. The influences acting upon the adults of the
two classes differ so much in nature and intensity that it is impossible to contrast
their effects.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say that in what has preceded the possessing class has been contrasted
with the proletariat alone, and not with the lower proletariat. It goes without saying
that the environment in which the latter live makes them the class most destitute
of the moral sense in the whole population.

<p id="ch2.2.1.c.c"><i>c. Marriage.</i> To form an idea as to whether there is a relation between crime and marriage, and
in this case, as to what its nature is, we must have recourse to statistics. Almost
all the criminal statistics give information upon the civil status of criminals (England
is the sole exception, I believe).

<p>Here, then, the married persons far outnumber the unmarried. However, neither of these
tables has much value, for first, nothing shows that from the total number of the
unmarried those who have not yet reached marriageable age has been subtracted, and
second, the corresponding figures for the non-criminal population are lacking, so
that a comparison of the two is impossible.

<p>But as the Hungarian figures have already shown it is necessary to make a division

<p>These tables show that the unmarried men (but not the women) are in general more criminal
than the married. However it is necessary to be careful as to this point. All these
tables fail to connect civil status with age, a fact which reduces their importance
almost to nothing, first because the tendency to crime differs much with age; and
secondly, because the percentage of married persons is not the same for different
ages. It is, therefore, necessary to compare the married and the unmarried at the
same age. The German statistics are the only ones which furnish the necessary materials,
and the conclusions to be drawn from these are the only ones which give us certain
information as to the relation between crime and marriage. These statistics have served
as the basis for the two studies of Dr. Prinzing’s already quoted from which we take
the following tables.
</p>
<p>First the relation between marriage and crime among men. But it must first be remarked
that married men are acquitted oftener than bachelors, as a consequence of which the
unmarried men are made, in the tables, to seem more criminal than they are—as the
following table shows:

<p>Here we have a higher degree of criminality among the married persons of all ages.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to give the figures for all the economic crimes and it will be enough
simply to give the general results for the rest. Unmarried persons are guilty of the
following crimes more often than married persons: aggravated theft (at all ages);
robbery and extortion (except between the ages of 21 and 25); fraud and criminal breach
of trust (except between the ages of 21 and 25)<span class="corr" id="xd31e38968" title="Not in source">;</span> forgery (except between 21 and 25, and over 60); and counterfeiting. The following
offenses are more often committed by married persons than by unmarried: being accessory
to theft, and receiving stolen goods (except between 30 and 40); violation of secrets;
usury; and procuration. It must be added that widows, widowers and divorced persons
show very high figures for economic offenses.

<p>Here it is the widowers, widows and divorced persons who are most involved, and then
the unmarried.
</p>
<p>For some other crimes we shall give only the results. Married persons are more often
guilty of the following crimes than the unmarried; domiciliary trespass (except between
25 and 50); perjury (except between 21 and 25, and between 30 and 40) and other offenses
against the obligation of taking oath; false accusation; unintentional homicide (except
between 25 and 30); offenses against personal liberty (except between 30 and 50);
and crimes and misdemeanors committed by public officials.
</p>
<p>For the following crimes, on the other hand, the unmarried hold the first rank: offenses
against public worship (except between 21 and 25); malicious mischief (except between
18 and 21); and arson. It is to be noted that for nearly all the above the widowers,
widows and divorced persons show very high figures.
</p>
<p>After an examination of the results found it is impossible to say that the married
persons show absolutely a criminality less in degree than that of the unmarried; there
is a variation for offenses as well as for ages. Only considered in general, the tendency
to crime is less in the case of the married than of the unmarried.
</p>
<p>As the following figures prove the connection between crime and marriage is quite
different in the case of women. It is necessary, however, to show the following table
before giving figures in support of this assertion.

who are oftenest guilty: aggravated theft (except between 18 and 21 and after 60);
fraudulent bankruptcy; forgery (except between 25 and 50); and violation of secrets.
We must once more note that the widows and divorcées show very high figures.

<p>In this regard the widows and divorcées show the greatest criminality, the married
women the lowest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb461">[<a href="#pb461">461</a>]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we may add the results for some other crimes. The married women are more
guilty than the unmarried in the following: rebellion<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e40716src" href="#xd31e40716">162</a> (except between 21 and 40); violation of factory laws; crimes against individual
liberty; and malicious mischief (except between 25 and 40). In the following the unmarried
women lead the married: perjury, false accusation, homicide and murder (except for
the ages over 50), unintentional homicide (except after 50), and arson. It is to be
noted that the widows and divorcées are at the head.
</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn is that the married woman commits more crimes than the
unmarried, but that this does not apply to all crimes nor to all ages.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>So much for the figures themselves; now for their explanation.
</p>
<p>It is very difficult, in examining the influence of marriage upon criminality, to
separate the moral consequences from other factors. We are mistaken, for example,
if we attribute to the moral influence of marriage the fact that married persons are
less often guilty of the great majority of economic crimes than the unmarried. The
fact that anyone marries is ordinarily an indication that he is in a material situation
more or less good. The danger that he will commit an economic offense becomes, then,
much less great than when he is in a less comfortable condition. The correctness of
this position is clearly shown by the statistics given, according to which married
men still young give a higher figure than that furnished by the bachelors. The reason
is that proletarians marry while still young. The material cares of these husbands
are then much greater than later on when their children have already left home, or
are at least earning their own living.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e40729src" href="#xd31e40729">163</a> If we examine the figures for insults we shall see that married men and women both
are more guilty than the unmarried. It would be very erroneous to conclude that marriage
increases the tendency to this offense. The explanation is to be found in the fact
that when a single dwelling (or barrack rather) is the common habitation of several
workmen’s families, living conditions easily become a permanent source of disputes.
In this case it is not marriage but bad housing conditions which appear as a factor
in the etiology of crime. If it were possible to separate these conditions <span class="pageNum" id="pb462">[<a href="#pb462">462</a>]</span>or these material consequences of marriage from its moral consequences, the difference
between the criminality of the married and the unmarried would not appear very great.
Especially is this true if we keep sight of the fact that the bourgeoisie generally
marry at a more advanced age than the proletariat. This brings it about that there
are more of the bourgeois among the older married people than among the younger; and
since, from other causes, the bourgeoisie commit fewer crimes than the proletariat,
the influence of marriage seems greater here than it really is.
</p>
<p>As for the criminality of women it must be noted that the unmarried women of the bourgeoisie
represent a greater proportion of the whole number of unmarried women than the women
of this class do of women in general. And since from other causes the criminality
of the women of this last class is very small, marriage seems to have a less favorable
effect than it really has.
</p>
<p>As for the consequences of marriage upon morality, I believe they are the following.
In the first place marriage has a tendency to increase the feeling of responsibility,
especially if there are children. Then when man and wife understand one another, when
they are happy in their union, no one will deny that marriage has a strong moral influence,
for, according to the proverb, happy people are not wicked. The proof of this is that
married men participate less than bachelors in the crimes of rebellion, assault, homicide,
murder, etc., while widowers are more often guilty of them, becoming addicted to alcohol
after the death of their wives, or becoming demoralized in other ways. However, it
would be more accurate to speak of the moral influence of love than of marriage in
the sense of legal monogamy. Happy married couples do not owe their happiness to the
legal sanction. Without it their happiness would be as great. On the other hand if
the couple is ill-assorted for one reason or another, then marriage has a very demoralizing
influence. Legal monogamy comes into play in such cases by rendering difficult the
separation of persons who do not understand each other, or of whom one or the other
conducts himself badly.
</p>
<p>The great power of a man over his wife, as a consequence of his economic preponderance,
may equally be a demoralizing cause. It is certain that there will always be abuse
of power on the part of a number of those whom social circumstances have clothed with
a certain authority. How many women there are who now have to endure the coarseness
and bad treatment of their husbands, but would not hesitate to leave them if their
economic dependence and the law <span class="pageNum" id="pb463">[<a href="#pb463">463</a>]</span>did not prevent. Holmes, the author of “Pictures and Problems from London Police Courts”,
who for years saw all the unfortunates who came before these tribunals, says in this
connection: “A good number of Englishmen seem to think they have as perfect a right
to thrash or kick their wives as the American had to ‘lick his nigger.’ Yes, and some
of these fellows are completely astonished when a magistrate ventures to hold a different
opinion. I well remember a great hulking fellow, with a leg-of-mutton fist, being
charged with assaulting a policeman. After all the evidence had been given, the magistrate
inquired whether the prisoner had been previously charged. ‘Yes, your worship, he
was here two months ago, charged with assaulting a female.’ As the prisoner declared
this was false, and indignantly denied that he had ever assaulted a female, the gaoler
brought in his book and proved the conviction. The prisoner then looked up in astonishment,
and said: ‘Oh, why, it was only my own wife!’ Only their own wives; but how those
wives suffer! Is there any misery equal to theirs, any slavery to compare with theirs?
If so, I never heard of it. I have seen thousands of them, and their existence is
our shame and degradation.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e40754src" href="#xd31e40754">164</a>
</p>
<p>Further it goes without saying that a marriage entered into for reasons of self-interest
is demoralizing.
</p>
<p>Although the above consequences of marriage must be mentioned, that our discussion
may be as complete as possible, and although they may have a certain importance for
the etiology of crime, yet their influence is not very great. There are causes of
criminality much more important, which may put those that have been named entirely
in the shade.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e40760src" href="#xd31e40760">165</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Before taking up the criminal consequences of the family, I am of the opinion that
this is the best place to fix our attention for a moment upon the criminality of women.
In treating above of the origin of marriage as it exists today, we have at the same
time spoken of the social position of woman.

<p>This table shows that women have a general criminality from 4 to 5 times less than
that of men. The figure for women exceeds that for men in the case of one crime only,
procuration; for the others it is smaller, and for some very small (<i>e.g.</i> assaults, assassination, etc<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>). The following table gives an idea still clearer and more detailed.

<p>The whole population being divided in 1901 into 50.5% women and 49.5% men, the figures
given above make the criminality of woman appear a little greater than it really is.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Here, then, are the facts, which may be reduced to this, that in all the countries
named the criminality of women is much less than that of men. However, it is greater
than we should suppose from the figures, since almost all the figures (except those
for France) have to do with persons convicted, and acquittal is much more common in
the case of women than in that of men. We have already given the figures for Germany
in regard to this matter. In England the percentage of convictions is 82% for men
and 79% for women.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e42884src" href="#xd31e42884">181</a>

<p>These figures lead to the presumption that in other countries also women are more
apt to be acquitted than men.
</p>
<p>Other reasons why the criminality of women seems smaller than it really is are the
following: As is shown by the statistics cited, the offenses of which women are most
often guilty, are also those which it is most difficult to discover, namely those
committed without violence. Then, those who have been injured are less likely to bring
a complaint against a woman than against a man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e42984src" href="#xd31e42984">184</a> But even when we take account of all these things, the criminality of women remains
much smaller than that of men. This may be explained as follows:
</p>
<p>First. An examination of the tables shows that women participate less in the crimes
which require strength or courage. The first cause is to be found in the fact, then,
that the average woman of our time has less strength and courage than the average
man, and consequently commits on the average fewer crimes than he.
</p>
<p>Second. It is clear that women take small part in sexual crimes (for procuration is
not a sexual crime but an economic one), which is to be explained by the fact that
most sexual crimes cannot, from their <span class="pageNum" id="pb473">[<a href="#pb473">473</a>]</span>nature, be committed by women. Another reason is that the rôle of women in the sexual
life (and thus in the criminal sexual life) is rather passive than active.
</p>
<p>Third. The small part played by women in economic crimes committed because of poverty
or even of greed, is explained by prostitution, which generally yields greater and
more certain returns than crime, and avoids the risk of prison.
</p>
<p>Fourth. A comparison of the criminal statistics of different countries has not much
value for the different reasons already given (Pt. I, Ch. II, sec. XIX). Only when
the figures are very different may one draw a conclusion from them. A comparison of
the tables brings out the fact that the criminality of women does not differ much
in the countries named. However, when we fix our attention upon the crimes and misdemeanors
more or less grave in the Italian statistics (assizes and correctional tribunals)
we discover that there is a considerable difference between England, for example,
on the one side, and Italy on the other. While the former country shows about 12%
(offenses tried on indictment) and 23% (offenses tried summarily) of women among those
convicted, the figures are 5 to 6% (assizes) and about 9% (corr. trib.) in the latter
country. This difference shows that the direction in which the principal reason for
woman’s small part in crime must be sought, is in her social position. This differs
less from that of the man in England than in Italy. However, there are figures much
more significant than those I have just cited. Between 1893 and 1899 the percentage
of convicts in prison in Scotland was between 36 and 37.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43011src" href="#xd31e43011">185</a> In Denmark from 1876 to 1885 about 26% of the convicts were women.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43014src" href="#xd31e43014">186</a> It is an incontestable fact that Denmark and Scotland are countries where the social
position of women approaches most closely that of men. Let us set in opposition to
this now a country like Algeria where the life of woman is entirely different. It
appears that there between 1881 and 1900 3% of those arraigned before the assizes
were women, and 4% of those arraigned before the correctional tribunals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43020src" href="#xd31e43020">187</a>
</p>
<p>An examination of the criminality of women in the different parts <span class="pageNum" id="pb474">[<a href="#pb474">474</a>]</span>of the same country, Germany for example, shows that the highest figures for female
criminality are furnished by the great cities and the countries most developed economically.

<p>As regards England, Morrison says that of misdemeanors 25% are committed by women
in London (Metropolitan Police District), and 33% in Manchester; while women commit
only 10% of the misdemeanors in Surrey, and about 14% in Lancashire.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43133src" href="#xd31e43133">189</a> The high percentages come then in the places where the social position of woman is
most nearly equal to that of man.
</p>
<p>Dr. H. Hoegel gives the following table for Austria. As the author says it proves
that the country where the woman takes the greatest part in the economic life gives
the highest figures for female criminality.
</p>
<p>As to the movement of the criminality of women the data that I have given, and others
that I have at my disposal, are not significant enough to lead to a definite conclusion.
In England it has been made out that there is a small diminution of serious crimes
and a slight increase of minor offenses, though the period of observation is very
short. Between 1881 and 1900 the relative criminality of men and women remained constant.
In Italy there was between 1890 and 1895 a slight increase in the absolute number,
and a slight, but fluctuating, diminution in the relative number. In the Netherlands
the proportions remained pretty constant from 1896 to 1901.

<p>Here, then, there was a slight but fluctuating diminution in the criminality of women
in proportion to that of men.
</p>
<p>It must be conceded that the figures given do not contribute much to the support of
the thesis that it is especially the social position of women which is the cause of
their being less criminal. This position has been modified during the years to which
the figures given refer. Women participate much more than formerly in the whole economic
and social life. One would accordingly naturally look for a great increase in the
criminality of women. Nevertheless these figures cannot, it seems to me, be used to
refute the thesis in question, for the following reasons:
</p>
<p>In the first place the figures given cover a short period only. They do not show very
much, therefore; for, notwithstanding the continual increase of the importance of
the rôle of woman in the economic life, the modification of her position in the whole
social life is not made so quickly that one can expect much of an increase in female
criminality in the criminal statistics of the last few years.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43433src" href="#xd31e43433">195</a>
</p>
<p>In the second place, most of the figures give the ratio of the crimes of women to
those of men; they do not then show whether the decrease in the percentage is due
to a decrease in the criminality of women, or rather to an increase in that of men.
This latter is the case, for example, in Germany.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43441src" href="#xd31e43441">196</a>
</p>
<p>In the third place the statistics at my disposal are not sufficiently detailed with
regard to the movement of the criminality of women, so that it is impossible to tell
whether there are changes in the qualitative character of the crimes even though its
quantitative character remains about the same.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43450src" href="#xd31e43450">197</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb477a">[<a href="#pb477a">477</a>]</span></p>
<p>A very conclusive proof of the thesis that the social position of woman is what explains
her lower criminality, is as follows. The difference in the manner of life of the
two sexes decreases as we descend the social scale. If the social position of woman
is then an important determinant of her lower criminality, the figures ought to show
that the criminality of men differs more from that of women in the well-to-do classes
than in classes less privileged. Now the figures already given (pp. 482 <i>ff.</i>) upon the intellectual development of criminals confirm our hypothesis completely.
Just so the tables upon the financial situation of criminals (see pp. 493, 494); in
Austria, for example, 0.2% of the women convicted in 1899 came from the well-to-do
classes, and 0.4% of the men. There were no well-to-do women at all among those convicted
of the graver crimes. Just so again, in the table of Prussian recidivists the women
form 4% of the well-to-do convicts and 14% of the poor convicts.
</p>
<p>Finally the figures for the influence of marriage upon criminality show (see p. 513
<i>ff.</i>) that the criminality of widows is very great. This proves that the smaller criminality
of woman is not to be sought in innate qualities, but rather in the social environment.
For widows are generally forced to come into contact with the economic and social
life of the world more than other women.
</p>
<p>We have still to explain how social position is a cause of a lower degree of criminality.
As to economic offenses, it must be remarked that the small part that woman plays
in the economic life has the result that the desire to be enriched at some one else’s
expense is less aroused in her than it is in man, and that the opportunity to accomplish
the desire is presented to her less often than to him. As to crimes committed for
vengeance etc., since women live more retired lives they enter less quickly into conflict
with others, and hence are less in danger of committing such crimes. Then the fact
that women are less addicted to alcohol must be taken into account. The almost wholly
negligible participation of women in political life explains why they are almost never
guilty of political crimes, a kind of crime rare enough in any case.
</p>
<p>After the long detour that we have made (in order to comprehend what follows), we
come now at last to the subject which especially <span class="pageNum" id="pb478">[<a href="#pb478">478</a>]</span>concerns us in this section, the influence of the economic and social life upon the
social sentiments of women.
</p>
<p>It results from this examination that, on the one hand, women feel generally less
than men the direct harmful influences of the present economic system, and those of
alcoholism; that the influence, very significant for criminality, of the environment
in which she passes her youth, acts as strongly upon her as upon a man; and that militarism
has no influence upon her, nor has prostitution itself upon the majority of the sex.
</p>
<p>Then woman has lived for ages in a state of oppression injurious to the development
of the social instincts, which forces her to have recourse to lying and hypocrisy,
those two defensive weapons of the oppressed. Just so also her retired life has been
an obstacle to the development of her feeling of solidarity with reference to persons
outside of the family.
</p>
<p>In looking the whole field over I see nothing to justify the opinion that the less
criminal character of women indicates a higher morality, whether innate or acquired.
The consequences of her manner of life, in so far as they are harmful to the formation
of character, are probably counterbalanced by those which are favorable. Her smaller
criminality is like the health of a hothouse plant; it is due not to innate qualities,
but to the hothouse which protects it from harmful influences. If the life of women
were like that of men their criminality would hardly differ at all as to quantity,
though perhaps somewhat as to quality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43483src" href="#xd31e43483">198</a>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.e"><i>e. The family.</i> Here we have to take up the question of how far the family in which the criminal
has been raised has contributed to make him such. It will be well to begin with some
theoretical observations upon the question, what is the effect of moral education
upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb479">[<a href="#pb479">479</a>]</span>a child (in the larger sense of moral surroundings), and how far does this education
in the end affect the adult?
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for us to tarry long upon this. The facts which we shall cite below
are more convincing than all the theoretical observations, and they show clearly how
great this influence is. Nevertheless some brief observations are necessary. It is
not far from the truth, it seems to me, to say that the power of moral education upon
the character, and that of intellectual education upon the intelligence, are equal.
The thesis has been maintained that the intellectual capacities of all men are equal,
and that education is the sole cause of the great differences which exist. No reasonable
person would maintain this theory; men differ enormously in their innate intellectual
capacities; some have great intellectual power, others have very little, while between
the two extremes is found the general average. What now is the rôle that education
has to play?
</p>
<p>Those who have small intellectual capacity naturally never become superior men, even
if their education is the best possible; though by virtue of proper education they
might become fairly useful. Those who have great intellectual capacity also need education
(though less so than the run of mankind), for otherwise their faculties will remain
dormant. Darwin would never have made his great discovery if he had been born and
reared in the slums of a great city and had learned nothing (even supposing that,
with his poor health, he had not succumbed to such an environment). His acquaintances
would have doubtless thought him intelligent, but the scientific world would never
have heard of him.
</p>
<p>It must be much the same with the moral faculty. We are not born with moral precepts
in our heads, but only with a greater or less predisposition to become moral. If this
predisposition, even though it be very strong, is not cultivated, there is no question
of morality.
</p>
<p><i>The child, even more than the man, is an imitator, and responds to suggestion in everything,
but especially in morals.</i> If we put the question: how does it happen that there are honest persons? the answer
must be: largely because in their youth they have become accustomed to be honest.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43641src" href="#xd31e43641">199</a> In his “Descent of Man”, Darwin says: … “Habit in the individual would … play a very
important part in guiding the conduct of each member; for the social instinct, together
with sympathy, is like any other instinct, greatly strengthened by <span class="pageNum" id="pb480">[<a href="#pb480">480</a>]</span>habit, and so consequently would be obedience to the wishes and judgment of the community.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43652src" href="#xd31e43652">200</a>
</p>
<p>A great proportion of the whole number of criminals have become such through the evil
example of those about them, or have even been deliberately trained to crime. Even
those who are endowed with great innate moral capacities cannot withdraw themselves
from these influences. One of the men most competent to speak on this subject, M.
Raux, director of one of the penitentiary districts in France, and author of one of
the best books upon juvenile criminality says, after speaking of the miserable environment
in which young criminals are brought up: “Let no one attempt to tell us after these
revelations that the child, born in surroundings which asphyxiate him morally, can
escape from vice. No nature would resist such demoralizing agencies. In order to convince
ourselves of the truth of this it would only be necessary to try an experiment, which,
it if were possible, would not fail to be conclusive.
</p>
<p>“The method would be to transport some children of the middle or wealthy class, neither
of which furnish any inmates to our reformatories, into families considered as types
of those from which our young delinquents come, and to substitute for them in their
former homes the children of poor families. This double substitution would have immediate
effects. Little time would be needed, very little, we are convinced, for the former
group of children to lose all trace of their early education and to become thoroughly
bad characters. As to the other group, a moral movement in the other direction would
be produced in them, but much more slowly. Vices are like diseases, they take hold
quickly, and let go with difficulty. There would long remain to the second group a
taste for vagabondage and gross pleasures. But when even these habits and impressions
of childhood are painfully eradicated, well-being, advice, and care would always keep
the child away from the possibility of theft, and after a certain time of probation
passed in the bosom of well-to-do and respectable families the public would certainly
regard our subjects, grown to be men, as upright and worthy of all confidence. Thus
we should have transformed children of good character into malefactors, and of the
malefactor we should have made an honest man.
</p>
<p>“This experiment, which no good family would consent to try for fear of the result,
would prove on the one hand, that any child placed in the living conditions of most
of our young delinquents would inevitably become vicious and criminal, and on the
other that if <span class="pageNum" id="pb481">[<a href="#pb481">481</a>]</span>circumstances easily make a malefactor of a child well brought-up, it is much more
difficult to transform a bad character into an honest man.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43661src" href="#xd31e43661">201</a>
</p>
<p>In consequence of what we have just said we may put two questions; first, do all those
who are brought up in such an environment inevitably become criminals; second, is
there, then, no difference as to morality between two persons of whom one is born
with a strong and the other with a weak moral disposition (supposing that both live
in the same unfavorable moral environment)?
</p>
<p>The answer to the first question must be that there may be sometimes those who succeed
notwithstanding the very bad surroundings of their youth. (As we have seen, an expert
like Raux denies this possibility.) But such cases are very rare and prove nothing
against the theory of environment, for it may readily happen that such persons fall
in with a better environment (at school, for example) which puts them on the right
track, if they have a strong moral disposition by nature.
</p>
<p>To the second question the answer must be made that one endowed with a strong moral
disposition, but raised in unfavorable surroundings, will perhaps become criminal,
and yet need not be as bad as another with a weak moral disposition, raised in a like
environment.
</p>
<p>There are criminals and criminals. Anyone who has given himself the trouble of reading
the biographies of great criminals knows that all have not been entirely corrupted.
It is with morals as with intelligence; in unfavorable circumstances Darwin would
not have become a genius, but even in such environment he would nevertheless have
been recognized as intelligent; so a child with great moral capacity would not become
an honest man when brought up in the company of thieves and assassins, but in his
own circle would have been considered as a good boy.
</p>
<p>Beside very bad environments there are the great mass of those that are neither the
one thing nor the other, in which the children neither have bad examples, nor are,
properly speaking, deserted, but in which, nevertheless, they do not receive an education
positively good. What is the influence of such environments? They are absolutely insufficient
for children with little moral disposition. These have need of a strong and well-taught
guide, without which they run much danger of leaving, sooner or later, the straight
path. It is evident that an education such as that in question, is insufficient for
the great middle class. The future lot of these young people will depend <span class="pageNum" id="pb482">[<a href="#pb482">482</a>]</span>especially upon the circumstances in which chance shall place them. The surroundings
spoken of will be enough for those who have great moral capacities, in the sense not
that a better environment would not have had a better effect upon them but in the
sense that they are more susceptible to the good than to the evil influences and—except
in rare circumstances—they will cause less trouble to their fellows.
</p>
<p>Finally, how far does the effect of a good education extend? What can a good education
do for a person born with weak social instincts? This is the well-known controversy.
For no one denies that those who are endowed with strong social instincts, as well
as those who have them only in moderation, and who constitute the great majority,
do not become bad when they are brought up in a good environment.
</p>
<p>It will perhaps be impossible to give a decisive answer to this question. For, since
we cannot make experiments with living persons, we cannot get sure results. And then
an education really good is so great a rarity that the number of cases where children
with little moral disposition are excellently brought up is certainly very small.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43679src" href="#xd31e43679">202</a>
</p>
<p>We may consider it as certain that children not well endowed will never become very
altruistic even if brought up under the best conditions imaginable. But on the other
hand no one would doubt that a favorable environment would develop, however little,
their weak social instincts (for no one is wholly without such instincts). For the
moment we cannot decide how far this influence may extend.
</p>
<p>After this introduction we come to the organization of education in present-day society.
Before stating the facts we must sum up what has been said above (see Ch. I., Sec.
III, B, of this part). The organization of our present social system charges the legitimate
parents of the child with his support and education. Most authors who treat of the
family wax so enthusiastic that they lose all critical sense. They note that there
are parents who love their children, perform all their duties towards them, etc.,
and they wish to make themselves believe that this is the general rule. But the subject
must be considered in cold blood. Certainly it would be ridiculous to deny the social
importance of the family; we may even say without hesitation that without the family
our present society could not exist. But all this would not be a reason for not seeing
its defects.
</p>
<p>Are there not many who are bad, even aside from criminals? Is not the majority of
mankind made up of those weak in character? <span class="pageNum" id="pb483">[<a href="#pb483">483</a>]</span>Are there not many alcoholics? Are there not persons who do not love their children
at all? Are not the persons numerous who have little patience and tact to guide children,
or who are lacking in other pedagogic qualities? Is it not true that nearly everyone
is ignorant of psychological and pedagogical principles? And have not most men their
whole time taken up with the struggle for existence, so that they are not able to
concern themselves with the education of their children?
</p>
<p>These are the questions that we must ask ourselves; and the answer to all of them
is categorically<span class="corr" id="xd31e43690" title="Source: ;">:</span> yes. And have not all these persons offspring? Most certainly. Then the results may
be imagined. It will be of the highest importance to know how many children receive
an education that is really good. I do not know of any statistics covering any very
great number of children. But it will not be far from the truth to infer that the
following figures are applicable, not simply to a limited number, but in general to
all children. These figures are given by Ferriani:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43693src" href="#xd31e43693">203</a>

</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of our present education is that it makes children egoistic.
It is to be expected. The organization of society obliges men to be egoistic, and
“like father, like son.” An apparent morality is the consequence. Children are taught
that they ought to do or leave undone this or that, not because it is needful to help
their fellows or not to injure them, but because it will be advantageous to them to
act morally, or because otherwise they will be punished. It is unnecessary to say
that brought up in such a manner, the individual will not recoil from crime because
of any moral restraint, when the opportunity presents itself of making a profit, or
when the risk of being punished is not great.
</p>
<p>As to education among <i>the well-to-do classes</i>, there it is especially egoistic. The children—speaking of course in a general way—are
<span class="pageNum" id="pb484">[<a href="#pb484">484</a>]</span>brought up with the idea that they must succeed, no matter how; the aim of life is
presented to them as getting money and shining in the world. Such principles are incompatible
with a really moral education, and the education of this class aims only at an apparent
morality instead of a real one.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43766src" href="#xd31e43766">204</a>
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the defects of this education, it is at least an education; the children
are watched, prevented from getting into bad society, etc. The consequence is that
the children of the well-to-do almost never get into the courts. This sad monopoly
is reserved for the children of the poor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e43782src" href="#xd31e43782">205</a> This is not to say that the defects of education among the well-to-do classes are
not among the causes of the criminality to be met with in the adults of these classes.
When a poor devil appears in court it will often happen that his counsel in defending
him will draw attention to the fact that the environment in which his client has grown
up is one of the causes of his fall; but it does not often happen that the advocate
makes a similar appeal when his client is from the well-to-do. It is generally believed
that nothing is wanting in the moral education of one who has not known poverty, and
has not been neglected; but this is a mistake. There can be no doubt that one of the
factors of criminality among the bourgeoisie is bad education.
</p>
<p>The figures of the following tables show that it is almost exclusively the children
of the poor who are guilty of crime.

<p>These figures show clearly that it is only an insignificant number of young criminals
who come from the well-to-do classes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44485src" href="#xd31e44485">210</a>
</p>
<p>I have been able to procure only a few data from other countries; their results, however,
are identical with those for England and France.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy.
</p>
<p>Of the 2,000 young criminals examined by Ferriani, there were 1,758, or 87.9%, coming
from families where a profound poverty reigned, and only 148 (7.4%) from families
that had never known poverty.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44503src" href="#xd31e44503">211</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Prussia.
</p>
<p>77.8% of the children received in the correctional educational institutions during
the year 1901–02 came from very poor families.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44513src" href="#xd31e44513">212</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb487">[<a href="#pb487">487</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is then the poorest classes that furnish the greatest number of juvenile criminals.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We come now to education among the <i>proletariat</i>. Here we meet first, insufficiency of the pecuniary means which education requires;
second, bad housing conditions, which oblige the children to pass a great part of
the day in the street; third, the total absence of pedagogical ideas; fourth, the
absence during the greater part of the day of the father of the family, and in many
cases even of the mother. The number of married women who work away from home is continually
increasing. In 1882 there were in Germany, for example, 507,784 married working-women,
and by 1895 this figure had risen to 807,172—an increase of 299,388 (59%) in 13 years.
In 1882 17.3% of the working-women were married; in 1895 21.5%.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44543src" href="#xd31e44543">213</a> There are no official figures but Braun<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44550src" href="#xd31e44550">214</a> calculates that in Germany there are 500,000 children under 14 years of age, whose
mothers are working-women. In Austria 44.6% of the working-women are married, and
in France 20.6%.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44570src" href="#xd31e44570">215</a> We have seen above (pp. 409 <i>ff.</i>) that juvenile criminality is increasing. This is explained in part by the increase
in the labor of married women, from which it results that an increasing number of
children are brought up without the proper care.
</p>
<p>Among the working classes there is no question of education properly speaking. We
can consider the children as fortunate if their parents do not set them a bad example,
are not continually engaging in disputes, and are not given to alcohol. It is plain
that all this does not make up a proper education; and yet how many children there
are who do not have even so much of an education as this!<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44580src" href="#xd31e44580">216</a>
</p>
<p>In the <i>lower proletariat</i> the situation is naturally worse. Not only is there a total lack of care and surveillance,
but children are even brought up to crime.
</p>
<p>Up to this point we have supposed the parents to be living. From the present organization
of society it follows that the condition of the children of the poor becomes very
bad as soon as the parents or even <span class="pageNum" id="pb488">[<a href="#pb488">488</a>]</span>one of them dies. Often private or public charity intervenes, but generally the community
does nothing for the orphan.
</p>
<p>As a last consequence of the present system it must be noted that children born of
illegitimate unions are in a still more precarious situation, since it is only the
mother who has to protect them.
</p>
<p>The community (in this case the state) concerns itself little with the education of
children; it makes education compulsory (at least in some countries) and deprives
parents of the charge of their children when they neglect them too much (this again
in some countries only).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now we come to the facts. They prove that the surroundings in which many children
live are an important factor in the etiology of crime. The figures at my disposal
are not as numerous as I could wish, but official statistics are not yet as full as
is desirable for sociological purposes.
</p>
<p>In reading the statistics which follow we must not lose sight of the fact that when
it is stated that a certain percentage of children were brought up in a bad environment,
it does not follow that all the others had a good education. The figures record only
the very grave cases, as, for example, where the parents have been convicted, or the
children entirely abandoned, etc. It is easier to prove, in making an investigation
into the condition of a family, that the children do not receive a good education
than it is to prove the contrary. Raux says that 36% of the parents of the juvenile
criminals whom he had examined had a good reputation. The author adds, however, that
this figure is too high for the following reason: “For certain officials charged with
furnishing information on this point, every man who, without being absolutely irreproachable,
has not been complained against, is a person of good character. So we have been made
to add to the list of those of good reputation certain families where the father,
drunken, idle, and unchaste, sets a very bad example to his son.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44612src" href="#xd31e44612">217</a>
</p>
<p>Some readers will see in what follows only a tiresome mass of figures—quite wrongly,
for those who know how to read the figures find in them a language much more convincing
and more shocking than that which can be expressed in words.
</p>
<p>Before beginning, the following remark must be made. We shall give, as far as possible,
the percentages of criminals born of illegitimate unions together with the percentages
of illegitimate births in general. We shall see that with some exceptions, even so,
the percentage for criminals is much greater than that for the population in <span class="pageNum" id="pb489">[<a href="#pb489">489</a>]</span>general. However, to make the comparisons exact it is necessary to know the percentage
of illegitimate persons among the population of an age to commit crime, and not among
the newly born. This percentage is very much less, because, first, the mortality among
illegitimate children is especially great, second, because a considerable number are
legitimated. In general the percentage of illegitimate persons among the adult population
is unknown. From researches by <i>Neumann</i> (“<span lang="de">Die jugendlichen Berliner unehelicher Herkunft</span>”) and <i>Spann</i> (“<span lang="de">Untersuchungen über die uneheliche Bevölkerung in Frankfurt a/M.</span>”), it appears that 3.6 times fewer illegitimate children in proportion, than legitimate,
reach the age of 20 years!<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44632src" href="#xd31e44632">218</a>

<p class="subheading">Austria, 1883–1889.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44696src" href="#xd31e44696">219</a>
</p>
<p>The following figures have to do with illegitimacy among the criminals imprisoned
in the years 1883 and 1884.

<p>In order to be able to make a comparison we must have the figures for illegitimate
births in the population in general. For Austria they are very high: in the period
1876–1880 13.84% of the children born living were illegitimate, and in the period
1887–1891 14.67%.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e44917src" href="#xd31e44917">221</a> During the period between 1883 and 1892 the general mortality of children under a

<p>With regard to the children received into the “Industrial Schools” during the years
1887 to 1891 there are the following data: 5% were <span class="pageNum" id="pb491">[<a href="#pb491">491</a>]</span>illegitimate, while for the same period 4.52% of all children born living were illegitimate.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45034src" href="#xd31e45034">224</a> Here we must take into consideration the greater mortality among illegitimate children.
There are no recent data, but in England in 1875 this mortality was twice as great
as that of legitimate children, and in some countries it is four times as great.
</p>
<p>4% were full orphans; 34% half orphans, 20% being fatherless and 14% motherless; 6%
had been abandoned by their parents; and 2% were the children of habitual criminals.
51%, therefore, were living under unfavorable conditions. For the pupils of the “Reformatories”
in the same period this percentage was 53.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45044src" href="#xd31e45044">225</a>

<p>It is interesting to note that with girls the influence of bad family surroundings
is worse than it is with boys, more than two thirds living under abnormal circumstances.
</p>
<p>However, confining ourselves to figures for the period 1887–1891, 49% and 47% of the
children in the two classes of institutions respectively came from normal families.
In what follows we see what their education was; different competent witnesses before
the “Royal Commission on Reformatory and Industrial Schools” affirmed that the environment
from which these children came was very unfavorable. The most important testimony
was that of Mr. Macdonald, one of the officers who receive the contributions of the
parents to the support of their children in the “Industrial Schools.” According <span class="pageNum" id="pb492">[<a href="#pb492">492</a>]</span>to him only 6% of the children came from homes favorable to their moral education.
In Manchester 68% of the parents of children in the industrial schools had a bad reputation;
14.7% were of doubtful character; and only 17% conducted themselves well.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45175src" href="#xd31e45175">227</a>
</p>
<p>Of 1,209 juvenile delinquents in the English prisons (1898–99) 90 (7.4%) had had no
education; 512 (42.3%) had had very little; 496 (41%) a fair education; and of 111
(9.1%) only could it be said that their education was good. 211 (17.4%) were without
father or mother; 183 (15.1%) had bad homes; 198 (16.3%) had none at all; and 30 (2.4%)
slept in night-lodgings.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45183src" href="#xd31e45183">228</a>
</p>
<p>If the environment in which the young criminals have lived is the cause of their fall,
a considerable portion of them ought to return to the right way as a result of the
education given in the schools in question. If this is not the case with all, this
proves nothing against the influence of environment, for the impressions received
by the child in the surroundings in which he has lived before his conviction are too
strong to be effaced by a comparatively brief stay in an educational institution (even
if these reform-schools were perfect). Finally, after they are set at liberty environment
may once more contribute to recidivism. The following figures show the facts in the
case:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45189src" href="#xd31e45189">229</a>

<p>Out of 100 children born living 8.41 were illegitimate (1887–1891),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45919src" href="#xd31e45919">232</a> while the mortality in the first year of life rose to 28.8% of the illegitimate children,
and only to 16.7% of the legitimate.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45925src" href="#xd31e45925">233</a>
</p>
<p>The figures given above constitute a crushing accusation against present conditions.
If we suppose that the number of persons born of illegitimate unions who have attained
the age at which it is physically possible to commit a crime are 6% of the whole population
(a figure which is certainly rather too low than too high), it follows that a natural
son runs twice as much danger of becoming a criminal as he would if legitimate, and
that this danger is even four times as great in the case of a natural daughter. The
other data are striking, especially those which deal with girls. There were 54% who
were orphans or half-orphans; 43% had criminal parents; 33% had parents who were vagabonds
or prostitutes, or who had deserted their children!<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45933src" href="#xd31e45933">234</a>
</p>
<p>As the official statistics furnish no other data, we will pass on to some of those
given by private individuals. In the work already more than once quoted, Raux gives
the following table, based upon careful researches and dealing with 385 juvenile prisoners
received in the “<span lang="fr">Quartier <span class="corr" id="xd31e45945" title="Source: correctionel">correctionnel</span></span>” at Lyons, to which the juvenile delinquents guilty of grave crimes are sent:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e45948src" href="#xd31e45948">235</a>

<p>Only 13% among them enjoyed a normal education (and who could say how far it was really
good?), while 87% had an education <span class="pageNum" id="pb495">[<a href="#pb495">495</a>]</span>insufficient or bad. The author arrives at the following conclusion: “… the population
of the ‘<span lang="fr">quartier <span class="corr" id="xd31e46076" title="Source: correctionel">correctionnel</span></span>’ of Lyons, more unfortunate than guilty, has been recruited for more than 16 years
from families the majority of which bore within themselves, by reason of the vices
of their constitution, the principle of disintegration; whose morality was detestable
or very doubtful, and whose means of subsistence were insufficient or totally lacking.
</p>
<p>“It is to these different causes that the young delinquents owe first their deplorable
antecedents, then their recklessness at the moment of the crime, their perversity,
their corruption, and finally, their arrest.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46081src" href="#xd31e46081">236</a>
</p>
<p>The opinion of M. Grosmolard, of great value because of the competence of the author,
who has been attached to the penal institutions of Lyons, is entirely in accord with
what has just been quoted. After having spoken of the strong influence of poverty
upon juvenile criminality, Grosmolard continues thus: “Besides material poverty, and
as an auxiliary to this factor, we find the moral poverty of the home, manifested
by the disorganization of the family. Whether it is due to the misconduct of the father
or of the mother, or of both, the disruption, whether private through separation of
the couple, or officialized by divorce, has no less deplorable consequences for the
children. There is always the depressing spectacle of domestic disputes, the abandonment
of the home, the weakening of parental discipline.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46087src" href="#xd31e46087">237</a>
</p>
<p>Concerning 400 children in a parental school in Paris we have the following figures:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46093src" href="#xd31e46093">238</a>

<p>These results agree, therefore, with those of the official statistics and of Raux.
The normal families were those which did not present any of the <i>external</i> marks of demoralization, and it is more than probable that their “morality”, in many
cases was only apparent.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb496">[<a href="#pb496">496</a>]</span></p>
<p>Out of 600 families from which juvenile criminals had issued, studied by Dr. L. Albanel,
303 (50.5%) had been disorganized by death, divorce, desertion, etc. In 268 (44.6%)
families the fathers and mothers worked away from home and the children were entirely
neglected; 291 children (48.5%) were confided to persons outside of the family; and
41 (6.8%) were brought up by their grandparents, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46149src" href="#xd31e46149">239</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, there is the following fact about the children undergoing correction in Paris
during the period 1874–1878: nearly 68% of them received visits from no one at all,
not even from their parents. What complete misery! Out of 100 children 68 in whom
no one was interested, not even when they were in prison.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46157src" href="#xd31e46157">240</a>
</p>
<p>The results obtained by correctional education (probably no more perfect in France
than elsewhere) prove the correctness of what has been advanced. If the thesis that
the environment is the cause of the criminality of minors is true, the conduct of
most of those set free ought to be good. Here are the results obtained in the “<span lang="fr">Quartier <span class="corr" id="xd31e46176" title="Source: correctionel">correctionnel</span></span>” of Lyons:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46179src" href="#xd31e46179">241</a>

<p>As I have already remarked, the fact that all do not lead good lives proves nothing
against the theory of environment, for it is quite possible that earlier evil influences
have not been eliminated in a comparatively short detention. To prove how strong an
influence the environment exercises anew upon discharged prisoners, let us look at
the following figures, which also have to do with the pupils of the Lyons “<span lang="fr">Quartier <span class="corr" id="xd31e46237" title="Source: correctionel">correctionnel</span></span>”:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46240src" href="#xd31e46240">242</a>

</p>
<p>With regard to illegitimacy among criminals I have data for the years 1885, 1886,
and 1889. In these years there were among those convicted at the assizes 2.35%, 2.25%,

(2.6%) from families entirely demoralized; 701 (35.0%) from families of bad reputation;

<p>In the period 1887–1891 the number of illegitimate children to 100 born living was
3.2<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46711src" href="#xd31e46711">251</a>; the mortality among illegitimate children during their first year rose to 26.6%
as against 17.5% among children in general (1885–1893).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46717src" href="#xd31e46717">252</a> It is not possible to calculate for <span class="pageNum" id="pb499">[<a href="#pb499">499</a>]</span>the population in general the number of individuals born of illegitimate unions and
arrived at the age at which they are capable of committing crime, but it is certain
that the mortality is greater among illegitimate children at each age than among legitimate
children, and that the number of children legitimated is very considerable. The percentage
of illegitimates to the whole population, then, is much smaller than 3.2. It is consequently
probable that in Holland also illegitimate children are more likely to become criminals
than legitimate children.

<p>Dugdale gives the following figures in “The Jukes.” They deal with 233 criminals imprisoned
in New York in 1875. 40.77% were orphans; 46.78% had been neglected in their youth;
17.16% were descended from criminal families, and 42.49% from intemperate families.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e46804src" href="#xd31e46804">253</a>

<p>Consequently 47.3% had lost one or both parents before reaching the age of 18; 11.2%
were of illegitimate birth—a total, therefore, of 58.5% brought up under abnormal
home surroundings. And what was the environment under which the other 41.5% had lived?
The table gives no answer to this question, but we may imagine it on the basis of
the figures given above.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Switzerland, 1892–1896.
</p>
<p>Among the 14,612 persons confined in the Swiss prisons during the years 1892–1896
there were 1,359 of illegitimate birth—1,044 men (8.5%) and 315 women (13.9%).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47445src" href="#xd31e47445">261</a> In the period 1871–1890 there were only 5 illegitimate births to the 100, while the
mortality during the first year was 24.0 to the 100 natural children as against 16.4
to the 100 children in general.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47451src" href="#xd31e47451">262</a> The influence of illegitimate birth upon criminality, therefore, is very great in
Switzerland; an illegitimate child is at least three times as likely to become a criminal
as a legitimate child.
</p>
<p>As regards the education of criminals, 22% of the women and 17% of the men had been
brought up by persons outside of the family. The following table bears upon the others,

<p>We are now at the end of our statistical data and also of our observations upon the

<p>Tomel and Rollet close their work “Enfants en prison” with these words, which I make
my own, and which are as applicable to adult as to juvenile criminals: “Has society
done everything that it ought to spare children the prison? We believe that with ourselves
[the reader] will answer, ‘No!’ Each child to whom we refuse protection will become
a delinquent. It is a wolf that we are preparing for the sheep-fold. If tomorrow he
makes his fellows pay his own arrears of injustice, if he steals, if he kills, he
will not say, ‘I commit a crime’; he will say, ‘I make reprisals.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47797src" href="#xd31e47797">266</a>

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.f"><i>f. Prostitution.</i> Prostitution has a special importance for the etiology of sexual offenses and of
procuration. However, it is not with this that we are concerned at present, but with
the correlation between prostitution and criminality in general, in the sense, that
is, that prostitution has a demoralizing effect upon the women who practice it and
upon the men who have intercourse with them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb505">[<a href="#pb505">505</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us begin with the effect upon the prostitutes themselves. And as with all observations
upon the relation between certain social phenomena and criminality, these must be
preceded by statistical data.
</p>
<p>How large a quota do prostitutes contribute to crime? This is a hard question to answer,
because, first, most criminal statistics make no mention of the occupation of prostitute;
second, when the statistics do mention prostitution they do not give the real truth,
since the facts will often be concealed by the woman interested; third, the extent
of prostitution is almost unknown, so that it is impossible to make the necessary
calculations.
</p>
<p>The following figures give us some information on the subject.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Austria, 1896–1898.
</p>
<p>It is to the study of Dr. A. Baumgarten “<span lang="de">Die Beziehungen der Prostitution zum Verbrechen</span>”, that I owe the following figures (which, I believe, bear wholly upon Vienna). In
the years 1896–98 there were 34 annually convicted out of a total of 2,400 prostitutes,
or 1.4%, not counting those who were punished for infraction of the regulations covering
prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47816src" href="#xd31e47816">267</a> The author thinks this degree of criminality very small. I venture to be of a different
opinion. If we note that criminal statistics, those of Germany, for example, show
that there are annually only 0.3 women over 12 years of age convicted to the 100,
we shall see that the part that prostitutes take in crime must be called more than
a small one.
</p>
<p class="subheading">England, 1836–1900.
</p>
<p>The English penitentiary statistics show whether the female prisoners are prostitutes
or not. As we have seen above (p. 499) the percentage of prostitutes rose in the period
between 1894–1900 to 15% of the total. The figures bearing upon earlier years, however,
show a much higher percentage; in the years 1836–1854 25.2% of the women convicted
(in London) were prostitutes<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47823src" href="#xd31e47823">268</a>; in the years 1858–1862 prostitutes made up 24.7% of the women arrested.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47830src" href="#xd31e47830">269</a>
</p>
<p>However, when we examine these exceptionally high figures, we must not forget that,
according to the “Vagrant Act”, the fact of being a prostitute itself is a misdemeanor;
a part of these women, <span class="pageNum" id="pb506">[<a href="#pb506">506</a>]</span>therefore, were convicted for this and not for having committed some other offense.
The following figure however, where this circumstance is excluded, also shows a great
criminality upon the part of prostitutes, and gains added weight from the fact that
many persons would not care to make complaint for fear of scandal: to each 100 persons
of both sexes convicted in London between 1843 and 1854 of “theft from the person”,
there were 36.0 prostitutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47844src" href="#xd31e47844">270</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">France, 1890–1895.
</p>
<p>In citing the figures upon the occupations of the prisoners (1890–1895) we showed
(p. 501) that about 5% were prostitutes. Compared with that given in the corresponding
statistics for England this percentage is small. It must, however, be taken into consideration
that a great number of occasional prostitutes figure in the penitentiary statistics
under the head of another occupation.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Germany, 1885.
</p>
<p>For this country I have been able to find only the following. Among the 2,900 women
imprisoned in the 16 great German prisons there were found in 1885 500 (17.2%) who
had already been punished for professional prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47865src" href="#xd31e47865">271</a> Although there are no positive data upon the extent of prostitution, it is nevertheless
certain that much less than 17.2% of women in general are prostitutes. The figure
cited shows that prostitutes take a relatively large part in crime.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy, 1891–1895.
</p>
<p>1,949 (1.5%) out of 126,717 women convicted in the years 1891–1895 were prostitutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47882src" href="#xd31e47882">272</a> Here also it must be taken into account that this number is made up only of prostitutes
by occupation, and that those who follow it as an auxiliary calling are grouped under
other occupations. Also, L. Ferriani, in his “<span lang="de">Minderjährige Verbrecher</span>”, concludes that of the 460 young female criminals studied by him, 243 (52.8%) were
prostitutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47891src" href="#xd31e47891">273</a>
</p>
<p>What data I have been able to secure do not prove—but render <span class="pageNum" id="pb507">[<a href="#pb507">507</a>]</span>exceedingly probable—the assertion that prostitutes show a high degree of criminality.
In my opinion this phenomenon is to be explained as follows.
</p>
<p>First. From its nature the profession opens a vast field for committing economic offenses.
</p>
<p>Second. Prostitution has a very demoralizing effect upon those that practice it. Those
who have not sufficiently taken account of the real causes of prostitution consider
this a confusing of cause and effect, and believe that it is the demoralization which
causes prostitution. In reasoning thus they forget that part of the prostitutes are
forced by poverty to take up this profession, and that in such cases there is no need
of supposing demoralization. Whatever may be the case with regard to the rest, the
profession would increase the demoralization already existing.
</p>
<p>All the authors who have taken up the question are agreed that this is really the
case. It is impossible to imagine a more degrading situation than that of a prostitute.
A woman who is continually forced to act in opposition to her feelings, who is obliged
to enter into intimate relations with the first comer however abject he may be, who
has become unaccustomed to all work, and who is despised, inevitably loses all respect
for herself and falls lower and lower.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47902src" href="#xd31e47902">274</a>
</p>
<p>A second bond of connection between criminality and prostitution is that it makes
possible a category of persons who constitute a permanent danger to society, namely
the “protectors.” The unregistered prostitutes need a man who will look after them,
and to whom they may attach themselves in their forlorn condition. In exchange for
this protection the prostitute gives up a large part of her earnings. In examining
the biographies of great criminals we see that a large number of them have belonged
to this category. It is evident that only demoralized persons can lead such a life,
but that this life in its turn increases their demoralization.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e47936src" href="#xd31e47936">275</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb508">[<a href="#pb508">508</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the third place, prostitution has a demoralizing effect upon the men who come into
contact with the prostitutes. We cannot lay it to chance that it is shown in many
criminal procedures that guilty persons have had relations with the world of prostitution.
This world includes only a relatively small number of persons; but the men who frequent
it are numerous, and the demoralization which ensues is prejudicial to society. This
demoralization is easily explained, as Dr. Lux shows in his “<span lang="de">Sozialpolitisches Handbuch</span>”, in these words: “The venality of the delights of love debases the pleasure; the
man learns to see in woman only a means of satisfying his lust; all higher regard
for woman is lost to him, his thoughts become frivolous and cynical, his character
continually more vulgar. Whoever has an opportunity to come to know the young men
of the large cities, must, unless he is already tainted with their opinions himself,
be shocked at the brutality and coarseness of their thought and speech. The whole
conversational material of our gilded youth consists of filth and obscenities; they
boast of things that a decent man would blush to be charged with. The young man is
demoralized and depraved by association with prostitutes, of whose standard of morality
he must beware lest he stifle in it every nobler feeling.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e48000src" href="#xd31e48000">276</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.g"><i>g. Alcoholism.</i> Here we have to take up but a single one of the ways in which alcoholism is connected
with criminality. For while acute alcohol-poisoning enters into the etiology of sexual
offenses and those committed in revenge, etc., it has almost no relation to the largest
of the classes, namely economic crimes. Acute alcoholism, therefore, has no place
among our general observations. With chronic alcoholism it is otherwise; for the man
who is subject to this undergoes a general demoralization by which he is predisposed
to crime even when he is not drunk. The manner in which this demoralization takes
place is not a question within the province of <span class="pageNum" id="pb509">[<a href="#pb509">509</a>]</span>sociology; it is sufficient for us that this consequence of chronic alcoholism is
universally recognized.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e48108src" href="#xd31e48108">277</a>
</p>
<p>To show the influence of chronic alcoholism upon criminality we can use only the direct
statistical method; that is to say, we must find the number of chronic alcoholics
among criminals, and then place beside this the number among the non-criminal population,
in order that we may compare them. If the latter figures are lacking, a comparison
is impossible. However, as we shall see, the percentage of chronic alcoholics is so
great among the criminals, that we can affirm that among the non-criminals the percentage
is very small. Consequently the influence of chronic alcoholism, whether greater or
less, is indubitably proved. Here are the statistics which we have at our disposal.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Belgium, 1874–1900.
</p>
<p>M. Masoin tells us that out of 2,588 convicts (sentenced for 5 years at least) who
entered the central institution at Louvain between 1874 and 1895, there were 1,157
(44.7%) addicted to drunkenness. Out of 216 sentenced to hard labor for life there
were 118 (54.6%), and out of 202 sentenced to death 121 (60%).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e48126src" href="#xd31e48126">278</a>
</p>
<p>In the prison of Mons Dr. Morel shows that out of 325 recidivists 181 (53.9%) were
given to alcoholic excesses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e48137src" href="#xd31e48137">279</a>
</p>
<p>It appears from the “<span lang="fr">Statistique Judiciaire de la Belgique</span>” of 1900, that in 1898, out of 19,169 recidivists (men) there were 5,976 (31.2%)

<p>These figures have no great value; they represent the number of habitual drinkers
to be less than it really is. The statistics cited divide all persons prosecuted into
eight groups (habitual criminals, prostitutes, vagrants, etc.) and under the heading
of habitual drinkers only those alcoholics figure who are not included under other
headings. If a vagrant, for example, is also a habitual drinker, he will be counted
among the vagrants and not among the habitual drinkers; hence this latter group is
much larger than the figures would indicate.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e48384src" href="#xd31e48384">284</a>

<p>The data given above show sufficiently, it seems to me, what the relation is between
chronic alcoholism and criminality. Notwithstanding their divergences the percentages
in the different countries are generally very high, and in every case much higher
than among the non-criminal population. The danger that these statistics are <span class="pageNum" id="pb516">[<a href="#pb516">516</a>]</span>based upon inaccurate data is not great, since the culprit has every reason to pretend
that his act has been committed in a state of intoxication, in order that he may be
less severely punished, and not that he is a chronic alcoholic.
</p>
<p>There still remains the question as to what is the degree of influence which chronic
alcoholism has upon crime. We should be exaggerating if we were to declare (as is
sometimes done by total abstainers) that whenever a criminal is an habitual alcoholic,
alcoholism is one of the principal causes of his crime. It is evident that in many
cases it is only an accidental phenomenon. Nevertheless, the figures given above agree
with the thesis that chronic alcoholism is a demoralizing agent and as such belongs
to the etiology of crime. Its influence naturally cannot be exactly expressed in figures.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49540src" href="#xd31e49540">299</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.h"><i>h. Militarism.</i> Although the influence of militarism upon criminality may not be an important factor
in comparison with some others, it is still necessary to speak of it here briefly,
and under two heads: its influence in time of peace, and its influence in time of
war.
</p>
<p>First, the influence of militarism in time of peace. The army is recruited in great
part among those who do not volunteer, in other words among persons who have not the
least taste for the military life and only serve for fear of incurring severe penalties.
Then a great number of the volunteers have become soldiers only from necessity, because
they could not find a place for themselves anywhere else. Finally one class of volunteers
have enlisted very young, for a long term of service, perhaps at the instance of their
parents, or drawn by the brilliant uniform, or other means of advertising peculiar
to the army. It is unnecessary to add that for the last two classes the military service
is often a deception, which makes them regret having engaged in it.
</p>
<p>The first source of demoralization in an army is to be found in its composition. When
you bring together a number of men, uneducated for the most part, with nothing to
unite them but constraint, and when there are already certain bad elements among them,
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb517">[<a href="#pb517">517</a>]</span>demoralizing influence makes itself felt at once. No moral bond unites these men,
but on the contrary a vague irritation begins to spread. And this demoralization is
not counteracted by that great moral force, work; a great part of the time among the
soldiers is passed in forced idleness, and the rest in learning things in which they
have little interest, if indeed they do not feel an aversion to them.
</p>
<p>It is naturally only by a discipline of iron that order can be maintained and the
recruits taught their trade. As soon as a man is debased by excessive discipline to
the rôle of a machine, his moral qualities deteriorate; the state of things thus created
brings it about that the great power given to superiors often degenerates into a thirst
for domination, and renders the subordinates servile, and yet of the opinion that
anything is right for them so long as they are not found out.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49610src" href="#xd31e49610">300</a>
</p>
<p>Since most soldiers are only under arms for a short time, the consequences named are
not of great importance for them, but those consequences nevertheless exist for the
professional soldier. The best known set of statistics upon the criminality among
soldiers is that of Hausner,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49617src" href="#xd31e49617">301</a> who shows that it is 25 times as great as the criminality of civilians. These figures,
however, have little value, because among the civilians are counted not simply the
men of military age, but the whole population. Further, a statistical comparison of
military and civil criminality will always meet with great difficulties, for, first,
there are offenses of which only soldiers can be guilty; second, the number of the
soldiers is not constant even in any one year. Although we cannot, therefore, express
in figures the harmful influences of militarism, it exists, nevertheless. But even
if we had the figures and they were to show—supposing a most improbable case—that
criminality was no greater among soldiers than in civil life, even this would not
contradict the evil influence of military life, since repression and the fear of punishment
are greater among soldiers than among civilians, and abject poverty, one of the powerful
factors in economic criminality, is totally lacking in the army.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49654src" href="#xd31e49654">302</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb518a">[<a href="#pb518a">518</a>]</span></p>
<p>The question may be raised as to whether the disadvantages spoken of above are inseparable
from every form of organization of the army. The answer must be that this is the case
in part only. The harmful consequences will partially disappear when the army is adapted
to the democratic spirit, and the service remains limited to the time strictly necessary
to make a good soldier; but the fact that the great mass of which the army is composed
has no sympathy with its aim and end but remains in service only by constraint, will
continue to exist. This latter circumstance will disappear only in the country where
the army is exclusively for the purposes of defense, to repulse an enemy that wishes
to destroy democratic institutions.
</p>
<p>We come now to the influence of war itself. That which, at ordinary times, is one
of the gravest crimes, homicide, is commanded in war; ravages and burnings are the
order of the day. It is inevitable that those who are driven to commit such acts,
lose little by little their respect for the lives and property of their fellows. War
arouses a spirit of violence, not only in those who take part in it, but in the whole
population.
</p>
<p>Happily wars are neither so numerous nor so long continued as formerly, so that the
consequences have no longer so wide a scope.
</p>
<p>Statistical research into the influence of war upon criminality is very difficult,
for criminality diminishes in time of war in an abnormal fashion, first, because a
great part of the male population of the age most disposed to crime is under arms;
second, the repression of crime being less vigorous makes the degree of criminality
appear smaller than it really is, which explains why the figures for the criminality
of women and juveniles are less.
</p>
<p>We often hear that war has also a good moral influence, since the whole nation is
then animated with a single ideal. This is true only in the very rare cases where
a war is really popular, in place of being the means of procuring material profits
for a small minority, while the great majority remain indifferent. It goes without
saying that even in these exceptional cases, the harmful consequences to the participants
still remain.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49712src" href="#xd31e49712">303</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb519a">[<a href="#pb519a">519</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have examined the tendencies of the present economic system and of its consequences.
Before concluding we must treat of the effect of
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.i"><i>i. The penalty.</i> The present codes give prominence to three kinds of penalties: fines, different kinds
of imprisonment, and capital punishment. We naturally do not have to say anything
of the first of these, since there can be no question raised as to its effect upon
the person upon whom the fine is laid. All that we can say is that this penalty fails
of its object since no account is taken of the financial condition of the person sentenced
to it, and it follows that while the punishment involved is only trifling for the
rich, it constitutes a heavy burden for the poor. Often a fine for a poor man who
cannot pay is simply a sentence to a short imprisonment.
</p>
<p>The death penalty also naturally is outside of our present discussion. I would simply
observe that among the numerous arguments against this penalty it must be noted that
it has no intimidating effect upon those who are present, as one would suppose, but
on the contrary a demoralizing influence; besides which the attention of the ignorant
class is drawn to the crime and the perpetrator of it. Those who are condemned to
death have almost all been present at executions. Out of a total of 511 of whom we
have information, there were only 15 (about 3%) who had never witnessed an execution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e49770src" href="#xd31e49770">304</a>
</p>
<p>In investigating the influence of punishment upon morality it is imprisonment alone,
therefore, which must be taken into consideration, so much the more since even in
the case of minor crimes it is almost always inflicted, while capital punishment is
either altogether abolished, as in some countries, or else rarely pronounced and still
more rarely executed.
</p>
<p>The following table shows how many times imprisonment is inflicted in comparison with
other forms of punishment.

<p>The imperfection of the present mode of combating crime is shown even by the evidence
of the statistics we have given. It would be hard to imagine a more complete fiasco;
in place of a decrease there has been an increase of recidivism; in place of making
men better, the prison makes them worse.
</p>
<p>Here is in brief the explanation of the fact. As we have already observed above in
treating of the definition of crime, one of the important elements in the present
system of punishment consists, for many people, in the desire to satisfy their revengeful
feelings excited by the crime. Those who realize that the punishment must be especially
aimed at the improvement of the criminal form only a small minority. The present forms
of punishment and the manner in which they are inflicted are little if at all in accord
with this latter point of view. At present the penalty is not much more than an evil
inflicted upon the criminal to satisfy the vengeance of a great part of mankind, and
at the same time to make it impossible for the criminal to do harm, either for a time
or else forever, and finally to terrify him and other men into not committing crimes.
<i>So long as punishment has this characteristic, so long as it does not aim at the improvement
of the criminal, so long will it fail to effect a decrease in crime, but will rather
bring an increase, as the facts prove.</i> No one, not even the most dangerous criminal is morally improved in the slightest
degree by vengeance wreaked upon him. Vengeance engenders only vengeance and no other
feeling. We can expect to see good results <span class="pageNum" id="pb526">[<a href="#pb526">526</a>]</span>from punishment only if the criminal, from the manner in which he is treated, perceives
that those who have him in charge wish him well, are trying to improve him, and that
his act was wicked and intolerable.
</p>
<p>There are two types of imprisonment; imprisonment in common, and in separate cells.
It is very easy to understand that a term of imprisonment served in common has disastrous
consequences for the prisoner. It is because of this system that the prison has had
the name of a school of crime, which would be a good joke if the facts were less serious.
All kinds of criminals, young and old, those sentenced for minor offenses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51481src" href="#xd31e51481">315</a> and those guilty of grave crimes, criminals against property and criminals against
persons, all find themselves massed together, so that instead of leaving prison bettered,
almost every one leaves it worse than he went in. No work is done, or at least only
stupefying labors; a real trade is neither practiced nor learned.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51498src" href="#xd31e51498">316</a>
</p>
<p>The disadvantages of this system have led to the cellular plan by which the contagious
influences of the prison are gotten rid of. Much was hoped for from the change, but
the statistics of recidivism show the hope to have been ill-founded; separate confinement
improves the prisoner no more than the older type. This fact is not difficult to explain.
Starting from the false theory that man has a free will, the non-determinists have
believed, and unhappily still believe, that the criminal left to himself and to his
own reflections will repent. As Sacker in “<span lang="de">Der Rückfall</span>” judiciously remarks, the criminal must not be left to his thoughts—if he has any—but
must be given new ideas. It is unnecessary to remark that it is not life in a cell
that will give them to him.
</p>
<p>Man is a social being; without life among his fellows he is like an animal out of
its element. How can he become better if he lives alone. The cell stupefies him, isolation
and monotony make him a machine, which later will not be fit for a free life. I do
not know a better description of the consequences of separate confinement than that
given by the competent author of “Pictures and Problems from <span class="pageNum" id="pb527">[<a href="#pb527">527</a>]</span>London Police Courts”, Th. Holmes. He says: “How is it that a man’s facial expression
changes during a long detention? How is it that his voice becomes hard and unnatural?
How is it that his eyes become shifty, cunning, and wild? It is no fault of the prison
officials; they cannot help these things; from the governor downward they are not
to blame. It is not because of hard work. From conversation with, and knowledge of,
such men, I gather that some of them at any rate would be thankful for more work.
It is the system that does it, the long-continued, soul-and-mind-destroying monotony,
the long, silent nights in which for hours men lie awake thinking, thinking, thinking,
driven in upon themselves and to be their own selves’ only companion. No interchange
of ideas is possible, no sound of human voices comes to call forth their own, and
their own vocal organs rust. Nor does returning day bring change, nothing but the
same duties, performed in the same way, at the same hour, and the same food, in the
same quantities, served in the same demoralizing way. They become strangers to the
usages of civilized society, and devour their food even as the beasts, but not with
the wild beast’s relish. To the use of knife and fork they become strangers; to a
knowledge of their own lineaments they become strangers; to high thoughts, amiable
words, courtesy, love of truth, and all that makes a man they become strangers, for
these virtues cannot dwell with senseless monotony. But if these things die of atrophy,
other but less desirable qualities are developed. A low cunning takes their place;
the wits are sharpened to deceive or to gain small ends; hypocrisy is developed, and
men come out of prison hating it, loathing it, but less fitted to perform the duties
of life than when they entered it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51550src" href="#xd31e51550">317</a>
</p>
<p>Read further the opinion of Dostoievsky: “I am firmly convinced that the boasted cellular
system pursues but a false, if specious, aim. It sucks the vital power out of a man,
enervates his mind, weakens and cows him, and finally presents the desiccated mummy
of a man made half mad, as a picture of reformation and repentance.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51555src" href="#xd31e51555">318</a>
</p>
<p>It would be possible to fill these pages with the well-supported opinions of those
who regard the cellular system as “an aberration of the 19th century” (Ferri).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51561src" href="#xd31e51561">319</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb528a">[<a href="#pb528a">528</a>]</span></p>
<p>To sum up then, we come to the conclusion that the system of imprisonment is not in
a condition to arrest the tide of criminality, but further that it is even one of
the causes of the increase of crime, since it makes the prisoners still worse. It
may be that in consequence of what I have just said the reader will remark that there
is no other expedient possible than imprisonment, whether in common or cellular. Although
the question of the treatment of the criminal as it ought to be is not one of those
with which we are at present occupied, I shall nevertheless say a few words on the
subject.
</p>
<p>It is possible to practice a third system, which takes its origin from the idea that
the crime does not proceed from the free will, but from causes which it will be necessary
to try to remove, in place of inflicting a useless punishment. It is to the credit
of the State of New York that it should be the first to put in practice this sort
of a system of combating crime (in the Elmira Reformatory). An effort is made to make
a man of the criminal, to turn him into a strong and sound individual; he is taught
a trade, his mind is elevated, his feeling of honor revived, in short, everything
is done that is necessary to stimulate the development of what is human in the man.
And the results prove that those who are following this method are surely on the right
road.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51623src" href="#xd31e51623">320</a>
</p>
<p>There is only one objection to this system; that many persons who have not committed
crime lead a life which in various ways is worse than that of the criminals so treated.
However, this very sound objection does not condemn the system, but rather the present
organization of society, which obliges a great number of persons to drag out a miserable
existence. The question of crime and the social question are inseparable; he who examines
the first without the second will not do much toward solving it.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>

<p id="ch2.2.1.c.j"><i>j. Imitation.</i> Before concluding we must give our attention to one more factor: imitation. We have
already pointed this out in speaking of the moral education of the young, but it is
also of importance with adults (<i>e.g.</i> the influence of the press, etc.; see above, C., <i>a.</i>, in this chapter), though not to so great an extent. When society shows very egoistic
tendencies imitation strengthens these considerably; when we see persons with whom
we have to do, always acting in an egoistic manner, our anti-egoistic forces weaken
little by little <span class="pageNum" id="pb529">[<a href="#pb529">529</a>]</span>and we end by doing as the others do.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51641src" href="#xd31e51641">321</a> In the crime of mobs imitation plays an important part.
</p>
<p>The proofs to support the power of imitation in the etiology of crime are to be found
in the biographies of most great criminals; bad example plays generally a preponderant
rôle in the drama of life. I know only a single set of statistics giving exact information
of the atmosphere in which criminals have lived, and so furnishing an idea of the
influence of imitation. It is that furnished by the “Elmira Reformatory<span class="corr" id="xd31e51668" title="Source: .”">”.</span> According to the “Twenty-second Yearbook” (1897) the character of the people with
whom the inmates had associated was as follows:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51671src" href="#xd31e51671">322</a>

<p>A second proof of the influence of the contagion of crime is found in the fact that
the criminality in the cities, where people come more into contact with each other,
is in general greater than that in the country. Although it is evident that we cannot
impute this exclusively to imitation (it is due, among other things, in part to the
great differences of fortune found in the cities), it still plays an important part.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e51726src" href="#xd31e51726">323</a> The following figures give a picture of the criminality in the large cities and in

<p>An examination of the statistics given shows that except for a few offenses the cities
are more criminal than the country.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e52322src" href="#xd31e52322">329</a> However, it must not be forgotten that the cities have proportionately a greater
number of inhabitants at the age at which there is the greatest tendency to crime,
and that the figures therefore give the criminality of the cities as a little greater
than it is. On the other hand there is a greater proportion of crimes that are not
prosecuted, or whose authors remain undiscovered. The English statistics, which do
not speak of the persons arraigned or convicted, but of the crimes known to the police,
are better in this regard.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to treat more fully of the rôle of imitation in the etiology of
crime; no one will deny it. As I have already noted, in Part I, in my criticism of
the theory of Tarde, imitation is not an independent factor, but dependent upon others.
In our present society, with its pronounced egoistic tendencies, imitation strengthens
these, as it would strengthen the altruistic tendencies produced by another form of
society. Man does not imitate that which is egoistic simply, but also that which is
altruistic. It is only as a consequence of the predominance of egoism in our present
society that the error is made of supposing the effect of imitation to be necessarily
evil.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="ch2.2.1.c.k"><i>k. Conclusions.</i> In recapitulating now the egoistic tendencies of the present economic system and
of its consequences, we see clearly that they are very strong. Because of these tendencies
the social instinct of man is not greatly developed; they have weakened the moral
force in man which combats the inclination towards egoistic acts, and hence towards
the crimes which are one form of these acts. To mention only the most important things,
in a society in which, as in ours, the economic interests of all are in eternal conflict
among themselves, compassion for the misfortunes of others inevitably becomes blunted,
and a great part of morality consequently disappears. The slight value that is attached
to the opinion of others is also a consequence of the strife of economic interests,
for we can be responsive to that opinion only when we do not see adversaries in our
fellows.
</p>
<p>The fluctuations of the mind of the person in whom the criminal <span class="pageNum" id="pb533">[<a href="#pb533">533</a>]</span>idea is born may be compared with the oscillations of a balance; and it is upon sociology
that must devolve the task of examining the forces which throw a weight on one side
or the other. When the organization of society influences men in an altruistic way
there is then a considerable force which can prevent the balance from inclining towards
the egoistic side. In our present society, the organization of which does not exert
an altruistic influence, this force is very weak, or does not exist at all. Since,
however, in every society, man must abstain from a number of egoistic acts, substitutes
have been devised to take the place of the weak or wanting social sentiments. The
hope of reward (whether terrestrial or celestial) and the fear of being punished (whether
by man or God) are charged with the duty of keeping men in order. As believers themselves
know very well, most men are not very responsive to divine rewards and punishments—heaven
and hell are too far off. Is it not believers who are the strongest partisans of rewards
and punishments here below for human acts? However, this expedient is only a very
insufficient one. We know too well that the rewards are very often lacking, and the
punishments as well. This is why many persons take the risk of committing the crime
they have planned.
</p>
<p>The present environment exercises an egoistic influence upon all men. We all participate,
for example, in exchange, which, as we have seen, is a great egoistic factor; and
other similar factors could be named that act upon all. On the other hand there are
other egoistic factors which exercise their influence only upon some of us.
</p>
<p>Let us compare two totally different environments in which an individual grows up.
Let us place him first in the slums of a great city; his father is alcoholic, his
mother a prostitute; he has never attended school, passing his time in vagabondage
up to the day when, still young, he has been committed to prison, where his education
in crime is completed. Now let us suppose this same individual to have grown up in
a healthy environment, where neither poverty nor extreme riches exercised their pernicious
influence. He has been brought up by rational and loving parents, his mind has been
developed, he has found later a good career, in which the greed of gold has not been
aroused in him. We shall then have before us two extremes, between which a great many
degrees are to be found. The environment is a very important cause of the great diversity
among men. However, it is not the only one; we still must give our attention for a
moment to:

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Men differ in height, in strength, in weight, in intellectual capacity, in everything,
in short. Apparently no regularity is to be seen in their diversity. If, for example,
we look at a crowd with reference to the heights of the individuals composing it,
there seems to be no regularity about them. However, this is only in appearance. By
placing all the persons in a line according to their height, and drawing a line at
the top of their heads we shall always get a curve differing little from the one below
(the greater the number of persons, the lower the point <i>A</i>, the higher the point <i>D</i>, and the more nearly horizontal the line <i>BC</i>).
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p534width"><img src="images/p534.png" alt="Curved line on a 6 by 20 grid, going from bottom left to top right. Letter A in the bottom left corner, B at position 3,1, C at 17,4, and D in the top right." width="469" height="144"></div><p>
</p>
<p>The irregularity is, then, only apparent; there is regularity in this sense, that
the persons of average height predominate very greatly in number, and that the very
short and very tall persons form minorities. This regularity in the individual differences,
discovered by Quetelet, has been recognized as a universal law, applicable to everything
living. The scientist named has demonstrated this not only for the height of the human
body, but also for its weight, strength, quickness, etc.
</p>
<p>Galton has proved the existence of this law for the intellectual capacity of man,
and a number of other scientists have done the same for the animal and vegetable kingdoms.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e52407src" href="#xd31e52407">330</a> Hence, “uniformity in variability” for all living nature must be considered as a
universal law.
</p>
<p>The same thing must be true for men’s moral qualities. In ranking any number of persons
according to the intensity of their innate social sentiments (supposing it were possible
to apply a measure to these), we should find that here also the law in question held
good; with the great majority the social sentiments would have only a <span class="pageNum" id="pb535">[<a href="#pb535">535</a>]</span>moderate intensity, while there would be one small minority in which they would be
weak, and another in which they would be very strong. We have no need to revert to
the influence of the environment, for we have seen that it gives to all an egoistic
or altruistic impulse, differing naturally according to the individual.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e52419src" href="#xd31e52419">331</a> Supposing that the environment were the same for all, there would still be great
differences between men as to the intensity of their social sentiments.
</p>
<p>What is now the importance of this fact for the etiology of crime? In my opinion,
the answer to this question will not be different from those which have been given
to analogous questions when we were treating of the etiology of prostitution and alcoholism
(pp. 407, 408 and 428), namely, that in every society, everywhere and always, an individual,
according as his social sentiments are weaker or stronger than another’s, runs more
or less risk than he of becoming a criminal, supposing the environment of the two
to be the same in effect. The man who, according to the intensity of his social sentiments,
would be placed in the line between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, would run more danger of becoming a criminal than the man who belonged between <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>. This point is of great importance for anyone who is investigating why the first
falls into crime and not the latter. But it has little weight for criminal sociology,
which concerns itself, not with definite persons, but only with general social facts.
</p>
<p>The evidence that individuals differ quantitatively always and everywhere does not
give the explanation of the problems whose solution sociology seeks, although they
must be taken into account. <i>The task that is incumbent upon it is to explain why individuals who, as a consequence
of their innate qualities, run more danger than others of becoming criminals, actually
become so.</i> He who is born with weak social instincts runs more <i>danger</i> of becoming a criminal. But the <i>certainty</i> that he will become such does not exist—that depends upon the environment.
</p>
<p>To sum up; I am of the opinion that individual differences are of great importance
for one who is studying an individual by himself, but that they do not belong to the
domain of the etiology of criminality.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">E.</span> <span class="sc">The Classification of Crime.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before proceeding to the treatment of crimes separately, it is necessary to divide
them into some main groups. It is a grave error (committed, however, by many criminologists)
not to take account of the very different nature of crimes, if one is concerned with
their etiology. It is, to be sure, permissible to treat conjointly moral forces which
may prevent the execution of criminal ideas and which apply to all crimes. I have
done so in the preceding pages. But we cannot treat the origin of the criminal idea
itself in this same way. There are criminals and criminals. There are enormous differences
between a professional thief, and a man who has been guilty of assault and battery
in a state of intoxication, just as there are between a ravisher and a political criminal.
And anyone who does not take account of these differences must necessarily limit himself
to certain generalities.
</p>
<p>I propose to treat of crimes divided into four categories in accordance with the motives
which led their authors to commit them. Three of these categories form quite definite
units, while the fourth is more heterogeneous.
</p>
<p>The first is composed of crimes that have an economic aim (economic crimes). The greater
part of the so-called crimes against property, such as theft, embezzlement, etc.,
belong to this category, but not all, for malicious mischief, for example, is generally
dictated by a desire for vengeance. On the other hand some crimes against the person,
like procuration, the object of which is economic and not sexual, belong here. As
for crimes against the state, we must add counterfeiting to this category. Then there
are other crimes that may be committed either for economic or non-economic reasons;
for example, murder (for the purpose of robbery or for revenge), perjury (for the
profit of winning a civil suit, or to prevent the conviction of a friend), arson (to
get the insurance money, or for revenge), etc.
</p>
<p>It may be urged here that, notwithstanding the similarity of their motives the crimes
of any class still present many differences. This is true in part, and I have accordingly
subdivided them. But on the other hand these differences are not very great <i>from the standpoint of criminal sociology</i>. For the jurist the difference between counterfeiting bank-notes, burning a house
to get the insurance, and procuration is very important; but for sociology it is much
less so. A man who knows how to make counterfeit bank-notes, will commit this crime,
whenever he wishes for any reason to enrich himself in a dishonest <span class="pageNum" id="pb537">[<a href="#pb537">537</a>]</span>fashion, but he will become neither an incendiary nor a procurer. A former prostitute,
on the contrary, will not think of making <span class="corr" id="xd31e52477" title="Source: banknotes">bank-notes</span>, but will become a procuress. The kind of economic crime committed by the person
who has a mind to commit such a crime, depends principally upon chance (occupation
etc.).
</p>
<p>The second category includes sexual crimes, and the fourth political crimes—two categories
quite distinct therefore.
</p>
<p>The other misdemeanors and crimes form the third category, and are more or less heterogeneous.
The principal motive of these crimes is vengeance. Among them are insults, malicious
mischief, assaults, homicide, etc. Other motives are: the fear of shame (infanticide,
which, however, may also be committed for economic reasons); then fear of falling
into the hands of justice (perjury, rebellion); and some others beside.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e52483src" href="#xd31e52483">332</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, to give a picture of the quantitative proportions of the principal crimes,
I add here some figures upon criminality in some of the countries of Europe. These
figures may at the same time serve to show to those who are not acquainted with criminal
statistics, how regular a course crime has from one year to another.
</p>
<p>It is crimes of vengeance, therefore, which form the largest group, then come economic
crimes, and then sexual and political crimes, both with low figures. If we do not
count the very minor offense of insult in the third group, the first and third groups
will be nearly of the same size. There are, then, almost no political crimes in England.
As in Germany, sexual crimes are very rare, and it is the economic crimes and those
committed out of revenge, etc., that are the most important. The latter preponderate
even more in England than in Germany.

<p>Here, also, the political crimes and the sexual offenses show the smallest figures.
The economic crimes exceed considerably those committed out of revenge, etc., a fact
to be accounted for in great part by the inclusion of vagrancy and mendicity among
the economic crimes. These tables hardly lend themselves to international comparison,
since certain acts are regarded as misdemeanors in one country, and as contraventions
in another.

<p>Finally, it must not be forgotten that certain crimes of a different kind (leze-majesty
and malicious mischief, for example) are sometimes committed simply that the author
of them may get himself imprisoned, and hence should be classed as economic crimes.
</p>
<p>We have now reached the question: how close a connection have the different crimes
with economic conditions? We shall give only a detailed sketch of the subject; to
treat it more fully would require extensive monographs. We shall limit ourselves to
indicating the general lines.

<h3 class="label">CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h3 class="main">ECONOMIC CRIMES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is necessary to divide these crimes into separate groups. Notwithstanding their
partial similarity they differ too much among themselves to be treated together. I
propose to speak of them under the four following heads: A. Vagrancy and mendicity;
B. Theft, and analogous crimes; C. Robbery, homicide for economic reasons, etc.<span></span> (that is to say, economic crimes committed with violence or directed against life);
D. Fraudulent bankruptcy, adulteration of food, etc.<span></span> (that is to say, economic crimes committed almost exclusively by the bourgeoisie,
while those of the first three categories are committed almost exclusively by the
poor). Some crimes, like that of embezzlement, belong to the second class as well
as to the fourth (for example, a workman’s making off with a bicycle loaned to him,
and the embezzlement of deposits by a bank director).
</p>
<p>It seems to me unnecessary to explain this division. It creates four fairly distinct
groups, which contain all the economic crimes. However, I must point out why I treat
vagrancy and mendicity in this way, while both are generally regarded not as misdemeanors
but as contraventions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e55015src" href="#xd31e55015">339</a> Properly speaking they ought not, therefore, to appear in a work on criminality,
but the following are the reasons why they nevertheless find a place here; first,
they are the most important and the most common contraventions; second, there is a
very close relation between vagrancy on the one hand, and criminality properly speaking
on the other. This relation has been shown by many authors. As Professor Prins says
in his “<span lang="fr">Criminalité et répression</span>”, vagrancy and mendicity are the novitiate of crime. I will only recall here the
opinions of two writers, Josiah Flynt and E. Sichart. The former, the author of “Tramping
with Tramps”, has given up a part of his life to tramping for some years in America,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb546">[<a href="#pb546">546</a>]</span>Germany, and in other countries, in order to familiarize himself with the vagrant
and the criminal; his conclusions accordingly have great value. He is of the opinion
that the vagrants endowed with great energy become professional criminals, to fall
again into vagrancy as soon as their physical and mental forces decline so as no longer

<p class="first">In examining the etiology of these contraventions, we perceive that different causes
lead to them. We shall treat them successively and endeavor to find their relation
to the economic life.
</p>
<p>First. As a first cause of vagrancy and mendicity is the fact that under capitalism
there are always workmen who cannot sell their labor. The number of these persons
increases greatly at the time of a crisis. When the men out of work have no resource
in their family and no longer receive aid from their union, they are obliged to go
from place to place looking for employment, and if they do not succeed in finding
it must have recourse to begging in order not to die of hunger. Statistics furnish
the proof that the army of vagrants and mendicants <span class="pageNum" id="pb547">[<a href="#pb547">547</a>]</span>is in fact made up in part of the unemployed who, though they wish to, cannot find
work.
</p>
<p>In the first place, vagrancy and mendicity increase in winter (as in general all economic
criminality does), when forced unemployment is at its height, and needs are most pressing,
while they diminish in summer. The following figures with reference to some of the
German states show these facts.

<p>These statistics justify the conclusion drawn by Ostwald, from whom I have taken the
figures for Hesse. This author is a competent witness, as he tramped as a vagrant
for some time himself. He says: “These figures directly contradict the statement that
antipathy to regular work forms the principal source of vagrancy and mendicity; especially
as there is no inclination to frequent the highways in winter. It is the need that
comes of unemployment that drives out these poorest of the poor; and whoever wishes
to do away with vagrancy must make the economic existence of the working people secure,
instead of visiting the victims of poverty with Draconian punishments.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e55528src" href="#xd31e55528">345</a>
</p>
<p>Another proof in support of the assertion that unemployment is a cause of mendicity
and vagrancy, is to be found in the fact that the figures for vagrancy and mendicity
rise considerably at the time of economic crises. The same phenomenon occurs more
or less when the price of grain or bread goes up. Then those whose labor is only poorly
paid must find some means of increasing their resources; and further when bread is
dear less of other things can be bought, which brings about a decrease in production
and consequently an increase in forced idleness.
</p>
<p>In the first part of this work I have mentioned authors who have shown for different
countries that the curve of vagrancy rises or falls as economic conditions become
worse or better. I add here the data that I have been able to find elsewhere.

situation improved, to become worse again in 1860, 1861, and 1862. The improvement
was restored in 1863, while 1864 and 1865 were fair; in 1866, 1867, and 1868 conditions
became worse again, but improved from 1869 to 1874. With 1875 things took a turn for
the worse, and this condition lasted till 1879, when there was a slight improvement;
1880, 1881, and 1882 were fair, while 1883 was a passably good year. In 1884 a period
of depression began, which lasted till 1888, following which there was an improvement
until 1891, with the succeeding years up to 1894 not so good. In 1895 things once
more took a turn for the better.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e55850src" href="#xd31e55850">347</a>

<p class="subheading">Netherlands, 1860–1891.
</p>
<p>Since there are no statistical investigations of the course of vagrancy and mendicity
I have composed the following chart from the official data.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb551">[<a href="#pb551">551</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p551width"><img src="images/p551.png" alt="I. Number Convicted of Vagrancy and Mendicity to 100,000 of the Population. II.

</p>
<p>A comparison of the two curves shows that there is a parallelism, tolerably constant
up to 1869. After this it ceases with some exceptions. The great fall in the price
of bread, beginning with 1878 (as a consequence of the agrarian crisis), even coincides
with a considerable increase in vagrancy and mendicity. To explain this we must consult
the statistics of failures. These show that the great increase of vagrancy and mendicity
coincide with an equally great increase in the number of bankruptcies, beginning in
1875 and lasting to 1882. For the following years there is no relation between the
two phenomena apparent.

<p>Although the curves of the price of foodstuffs and of vagrancy do not exactly conform,
the influence of the price is none the less evident. The three periods of high prices
(1854–56, 1860–62, and 1867–68) coincide with high figures for vagrancy and mendicity.
(It is to be noted that the effect of an economic depression does not always make
itself felt the following year.)
</p>
<p class="subheading">Kingdom of Saxony, 1889–1892.
</p>
<p>Bebel showed that mendicity increased greatly in the above period (a crisis of great
intensity). (See pp. 228–229 of this work.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56226src" href="#xd31e56226">351</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that these data show sufficiently that the increase or diminution
of vagrancy and mendicity are regulated by the economic situation; in other words,
that a great many persons become guilty of these contraventions not because they are
not <i>willing</i> to work, but <i>entirely</i> as a consequence of an unfavorable economic environment. There are some exceptions
to this rule. Above (pp. 89–90) I have shown that these exceptions do not weaken the
general conclusion; the unfavorable influence of the economic depression may be neutralized
by counter-determinants. It must <span class="pageNum" id="pb553">[<a href="#pb553">553</a>]</span>further be remarked especially with regard to vagrancy and mendicity, that the application
of the laws relative to these offenses is quite arbitrary, and it happens at the time
of a crisis that the courts do not punish those who are guilty of them, whence it
follows that the statistics do not give an accurate picture of the reality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56251src" href="#xd31e56251">352</a>
</p>
<p>It is impossible to fix exactly how far the influence of economic depressions extends;
in other words, we cannot determine the number of vagrants and mendicants who become
such <i>directly</i> through forced idleness. When it is necessary to record a certain number of convictions
for vagrancy and mendicity, although the economic conditions are most favorable, we
shall not even then be able to say that this proves that the convictions fell only
upon persons who could have found work, but did not wish it.
</p>
<p>Under the present economic system unemployment is chronic, that is to say, it is present
even in times of economic prosperity. Consequently it has not been proved that those
who are convicted during these periods are necessarily lazy and do not want to work.
The only figure that I have been able to find with regard to the importance of this
cause of vagrancy and mendicity is this: that in Germany, out of a total of 200,000
mendicants, there are 80,000 (40%) who are really in search of work.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56264src" href="#xd31e56264">353</a> This figure being only approximate, its significance is not great.
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of this cause, we must say something with regard to the
objection that the workers who, on account of a long period of unemployment, fall
finally into vagrancy, are inferior to the average, generally do not know a trade,
and are often addicted to alcohol; and that consequently in this case an individual
factor plays a rôle beside the economic factor.
</p>
<p>It is true that most of the vagrants and mendicants do not know a trade, nor are worth
much as workmen. In his study Dr. Bonhoeffer says that 55.4% of the vagrants and mendicants
examined by him had not learned a trade, or had learned it insufficiently.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56273src" href="#xd31e56273">354</a> This author also shows (we shall return to this later) that a great proportion of
these people are also physically inferior to the average. This inferiority is in part
not the cause but the effect of the conditions under which they have been living (insufficient
food, etc.),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56287src" href="#xd31e56287">355</a> and in part congenital weakness.
</p>
<p>However, supposing that each of these individuals knew a trade, <span class="pageNum" id="pb554">[<a href="#pb554">554</a>]</span>supposing also that they were all robust and healthy and in a condition to work regularly,
would there then be fewer persons without work than there are now? <i>The answer to this question must be negative.</i> Even if every workman knew a trade, this fact would not increase the demand for skilled
workmen. At any given time the labor market demands only a certain number of skilled
workmen, and a certain other number of unskilled laborers; the number of unskilled
laborers available has no influence. The same thing is true as to fitness for work;
if all the workmen had the same energy, the same zeal, etc., this would not increase
the demand for workmen; this demand is regulated by other factors.
</p>
<p>In my opinion it cannot be a question of individual causes; individual differences
explain partially who remain without work, and so become vagrants; but it is the economic
system which causes the existence of persons without work. <i>Vagrancy and mendicity would be no less extensive even if all the workers knew a trade
and were equal in zeal and energy.</i>
</p>
<p>In the second place the world of vagrants and mendicants is composed of people too
old to work, or more or less incapable of working, from physical or psychical causes,
so that they are no longer employed. So far as I know the data concerning the age
of vagrants and mendicants are not numerous; I can cite those that follow.

</p>
<p>In the work of <span class="corr" id="xd31e56539" title="Source: Loewenstimm">Löwenstimm</span> already cited we find mentioned the fact that out of a total of 7,916 mendicants
arrested in St. Petersburg, 1,185 (14.9%) were between 50 and 60 years of age, and
982 (12.4%) over 60.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56542src" href="#xd31e56542">358</a>
</p>
<p>As has been said, a certain number of vagrants are weak or sickly, and consequently
are nearly or quite unable to work. In “<span lang="fr">Les habitués des prisons de Paris</span>”, Dr. Laurent gives the following description of some vagrants observed by him, true
types of this kind of individual. “I have known at the Santé in recent years an individual
who has passed almost the whole of his life in prison, who was born and lived in misery.
A natural child, his mother received him as a mistake and a burden and tried to destroy
herself and him. Later, convulsions twisted him upon a hospital bed, and he has remained
half-paralyzed. So far from knowing how to read or write he can hardly see clearly,
for an opaque film covers his left eye. He has undergone more than twenty sentences
for mendicity and vagrancy, and he is still only 37 years old. He leaves prison only
to enter it again. So he complains bitterly and blames the judicial authorities, who,
instead of placing him in an asylum, where he belongs, cast him into prison, because,
says he, the food does not cost so much.
</p>
<p>“An individual 29 years old, the son of a drunkard and a consumptive, has already
been seven times sentenced for mendicity. He has been half-paralyzed since he was
13 months old and can walk only with crutches. Epileptic in addition, he drifts from
prison to prison.
</p>
<p>“These facts are very common, and it is impossible to estimate how <span class="pageNum" id="pb556">[<a href="#pb556">556</a>]</span>many of these poor devils live in the prisons, which are a kind of refuge for them.
Lately I saw a blind man who had been arrested for mendicity and sentenced to a fortnight
in prison.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56555src" href="#xd31e56555">359</a>

</p>
<p>Here it must be noted that in the years 1896–97 there were on the average only 9%
of the conscripts of Silesia who were incapable of military service.
</p>
<p>The other figures that are known agree with the ones I have just cited. Dr. Kurella
found 20% to 30% of imbeciles or epileptics among the vagrants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56619src" href="#xd31e56619">360</a> Dr. Mendel also found a great number of psychic abnormalities among the vagrants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56626src" href="#xd31e56626">361</a>
</p>
<p>All that I have just said demonstrates sufficiently, I believe, that the cause named
above plays a considerable rôle in the etiology of mendicity and vagrancy. It is still
necessary to give an answer to the question: do all the individuals who fall under
the unfavorable conditions named under one and two, become vagrants or mendicants?
It is evident that the answer must be negative. Three expedients offer themselves
to one who has fallen into the blackest poverty; mendicity, theft, and suicide. It
is partly chance (opportunity etc.), and partly the individual predisposition which
fixes what anyone under the conditions named will become, whether a mendicant or a
thief. Generally those who have still some intelligence <span class="pageNum" id="pb557">[<a href="#pb557">557</a>]</span>and energy become thieves, the rest vagrants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56656src" href="#xd31e56656">362</a> The third expedient, suicide, also is frequently met with among the lower proletariat.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56666src" href="#xd31e56666">363</a> Those who have recourse to it are either those who have known better conditions and
find that the miserable existence that mendicity procures is not worth the trouble
of living, or those who have lost all energy. Sometimes persons commit suicide to
escape the shame of begging or stealing. These have been called “the heroes of virtue”;
but, considered from another point of view, they may also be called the “victims of
vice”, the vice of others, of course. These have been born with a very strong moral
disposition and have lived in an environment where this disposition has been developed.
These cases prove the degree of intensity that the social sentiments can attain; they
are stronger than the fundamental desire to live, although those whom these “heroes”
are unwilling to injure, reject these sentiments, by abandoning their fellows who
find themselves in want.
</p>
<p>Third. A third category of mendicants and vagrants is made up of children and young
people. Let us see what relation there is between this fact and the economic and social
environment. All those who have taken up this subject are agreed that a great proportion
of the children are systematically taught to beg by their parents. Whatever may be
the cause for which the parents act thus, these children are entirely the victims
of the detestable atmosphere in which they are forced to live. Brought up in a wholesome
environment they would become neither mendicants nor vagrants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56677src" href="#xd31e56677">364</a>
</p>
<p>Another part of the vagrant body is made up of children who are either illegitimate
or orphans, or deserted by their parents, or forced by bad treatment to run away from
home. Tomel and Rollet mention the following typical case. A girl of 16 was charged
with vagrancy, and made this heart-rending statement of her case before the tribunal:
“I went on Friday to find the police commissioner of the ward; I told him that I had
been without a lodging place for 15 days, and that I had not eaten for 48 hours. I
was employed at the house of a wine merchant, who, when my mother died three years
ago, took me as a servant (at 13 years of age) at two sous a day as wages. But my
employer failed, his shop was closed, and I had to go out and wander in search of
work without finding anything. My father, sentenced <span class="pageNum" id="pb558">[<a href="#pb558">558</a>]</span>to hard labor for life, died in New Caledonia. I have no longer any mother, and since
I did not wish to imitate my grown-up sister, who leads a bad life, I preferred to
get myself arrested.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56716src" href="#xd31e56716">365</a>
</p>
<p>It is difficult to tell how many of these children there are. The only figures that
I know of are the following.

</p>
<p>We must now speak of another kind of vagrant and mendicant, those whom some criminologists
have called born-vagabonds; children who run away from home to meet with adventures
and to see something more than the neighborhood where they live. It makes little difference
to us here whence comes this desire; everyone, especially every child, has it more
or less (who is there who does not love to travel?) and there are those in whom it
is very strong. “Who among us,” say Tomel and Rollet, “at certain moments of existence,
does not feel the desire to break with social conventions, or more simply, to break
through the circle of his horizon, in order to depart in search of the unknown? Put
money in the pocket of the tramp and you make a tourist. The sportsman and the delinquent
are separated only by the thickness of some hundred-sou pieces.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56799src" href="#xd31e56799">367</a>
</p>
<p>These authors have hit the truth of the matter. Such children are called born-vagabonds,
but then we meet thousands of born-vagabonds who have never become vagabonds in reality.
The children who have a great love of adventure are found in all classes of society,
but only those who come from among the poor become vagrants. It is in <span class="pageNum" id="pb559">[<a href="#pb559">559</a>]</span>poverty then that we find the “<span lang="la"><span class="corr" id="xd31e56808" title="Source: casua">causa</span> efficiens</span>”; the same inclination that brings poor children to prison, would perhaps lead them
to a post of honor if they had lived in better surroundings. There are people of all
kinds among criminals, and it cannot be denied that the majority of them are inferior
in every way. But this does not apply to this class of little vagrants. Those who,
as a consequence of years of experience, have a right to speak, are agreed that such
children can be made useful members of society, if they are rationally guided.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56812src" href="#xd31e56812">368</a> They are bold and energetic lads. Could it be believed that all the boys who, in
1889, came on foot to Paris from all parts of France to see the Eiffel tower (there
were some of them under seven years of age) were not brave and energetic? Brought
up in another environment they would have become sailors or explorers, or would have
undertaken long journeys as tourists—while now they get into prison, to descend later
lower and lower.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56820src" href="#xd31e56820">369</a>
</p>
<p>Fourth. Finally, the fourth category of vagrants and mendicants. This consists of
those not included in the other three classes of people who are physically in a condition
to work and who have opportunity to do so, but are not willing to work. It is hard
to determine with certainty how large a part of the army of vagrants and mendicants
they make up. But it seems to me certain that the facts given above prove that they
are not as numerous as some authors and many other people believe. Besides, how is
it that the philanthropic institutions where everyone admitted has to work, are always
full, if it is true that most vagrants are persons who are not willing to work?
</p>
<p>The vagrants of this class are then lazy persons, unwilling to work, but living at
the expense of others, and consequently parasites. It is with reason that many authors
have blamed such persons (though, as Dr. Colajanni says, justice would require that
we should include all do-nothings, and not the poor only). But this does not advance
the cause of sociology; her task is to find the causes of the phenomenon.
</p>
<p>It is incontestable that the zeal and energy, evidenced by modern peoples in their
work, are not innate but acquired. All sound individuals <span class="pageNum" id="pb560">[<a href="#pb560">560</a>]</span>have, not in the same measure, it is true, an innate tendency to exercise their muscles
and their intellectual faculties, but without external causes this inclination does
not go very far. The primitive peoples work no more than is necessary to provide for
their very moderate needs. They find people laughable who work more than is strictly
necessary.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56872src" href="#xd31e56872">370</a> The enormous change which took place in the method of production little by little
induced men to produce a greater and greater amount of work; on the one hand were
the slaves, forced to labor hard, and on the other hand the property owners driven
to work by the desire of profit. In our present society the case is almost the same;
the great mass are forced to work by fear of poverty, the smaller number by the desire
for gain. And then the great majority of men have been accustomed to work from infancy;
much work is done from necessity, but much from habit, which causes a feeling of uneasiness
when one cannot work.
</p>
<p>The first reason why there are people who do not want to work, is that they have not
been accustomed to it from childhood. In general children, like primitive people,
who are analogous to them in many ways, show little zeal for work. It is necessary
to train them for a fairly long time before they set themselves to work assiduously.
What will all those children whose parents have neglected them, or who have even taught
them to beg, turn into when they are grown up, if not into vagrants and mendicants?
They have never learned any trade, have never become accustomed to work, have never
found any pleasure in it, so that later in life they will never have any desire to
do anything.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56883src" href="#xd31e56883">371</a>
</p>
<p>Part of those who have not been able to work for a long time go the same road, they
lose the habit of working, become lazy, and in the end are not willing to do anything
any more.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56894src" href="#xd31e56894">372</a> These, to be sure, are the least diligent by nature, but that would not alone send
them into vagrancy if they had always been able to find work.
</p>
<p>However, there is still one more thing to be said about the circumstances which give
rise to this class of individuals. In the first place, the long duration, the monotony,
and the disagreeable features of the work of the proletariat, which, as a consequence
is rather hated than loved.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56904src" href="#xd31e56904">373</a> In the second place: the small wages of a large part of the workers, and the comparatively
large amounts that clever beggars <span class="pageNum" id="pb561">[<a href="#pb561">561</a>]</span>are able to secure. Flynt gives the following data as to the “earnings” of tramps;
in New York, $1 a day; in the Eastern States generally, from 50 cents to $1 or $2,
without counting food; in New Orleans a skilful beggar can “earn” $1 a day. He estimates
that in Germany the daily receipts of a beggar are from a mark and a half to four
marks, and food; in England most beggars get from 18 pence to two shillings, though
some very clever ones even get as much as 10 shillings.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56920src" href="#xd31e56920">374</a> <span class="corr" id="xd31e56924" title="Source: Loewenstimm">Löwenstimm</span> tells that in Petrograd a skilful beggar has a daily income of three rubles.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56927src" href="#xd31e56927">375</a> Florian and Cavaglieri say that in Paris a beggar gets four francs, and if he is
very clever, even as much as twenty-five francs, a day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56932src" href="#xd31e56932">376</a>
</p>
<p>In some cases, then, it is more profitable, and in all cases more easy, not to work.
In consequence of these facts we read very often that the public ought not to give
to these idlers. But the public cannot distinguish this class of mendicants from the
others. It is certainly true that professional mendicity would diminish if nothing
were given to mendicants; but on the other hand the great misery among the other poor
would be aggravated still more. And I venture to doubt whether the advantage thus
gained on one side would counterbalance the disadvantage created on the other.
</p>
<p>And these laments upon the subject of the stupidity of the public are generally accompanied
by anathemas upon those who prefer the life of the parasite to work. No one would
naturally be inclined to excuse these individuals. But it is necessary to look at
the question from both sides. If these people are blamed, blame must be attached also
to a state of society <i>in which honest labor is so poorly paid that begging is often more lucrative</i>. These individuals are cunning egoists and as long as society is organized as it
is, they are right from their point of view. To be sure, they have no feeling of honor,
they attach no value to the opinion of others, but the feeling of honor is not innate
but acquired. As the facts show, vagrants generally come from an environment where
there can be no question of a development of moral qualities. Dr. Bonhoeffer shows,
for example, that about 45% of the vagrants examined by him had been brought up in
bad home surroundings (alcoholism of the parents, etc.). Then, as we have seen above,
the social feelings can be developed only where there is reciprocity. I should like
to know whether society really concerns itself with the fate of these unfortunates
to such an extent that they in their turn care greatly for the opinion of this same
society. <span class="pageNum" id="pb562">[<a href="#pb562">562</a>]</span>Certainly not. They are pariahs, and since they are such the contempt of a hostile
world is a matter of indifference.
</p>
<p>As we come to the conclusion of our observations upon the etiology of vagrancy and
mendicity, we have still but one category to consider, that of those who are indolent
by nature. There are individuals in whom assiduous labor of any kind awakens a strong
feeling of discomfort.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56945src" href="#xd31e56945">377</a> As we have already stated above, in speaking of poverty in general (see p. 288),
the cause of this phenomenon is a species of neurasthenia, more especially physical.
It is necessary to recognize that, while these individuals are out of harmony with
society, they are sick and must be cared for if society is to avoid trouble. Besides,
Professor Benedict, who was the first to point out physical neurasthenia, himself
recognizes<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56976src" href="#xd31e56976">378</a> that such sick persons need not become vagrants, if they are brought up in a favorable
environment, and that later the struggle for existence will not be painful to them.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>To sum up, it is evident that the principal causes of vagrancy and mendicity are lack
of work, the want of care for the old, the sick, and the weak, the abandonment of
poor children, the low wages and long hours of the workers. The persons who run most
danger of being incorporated in the army of vagrants are the weak, whether mentally
or physically, but this need not necessarily happen; the “<span lang="la">causa causarum</span>” is the environment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e56994src" href="#xd31e56994">379</a>
</p>
<p>History proves this also. If vagrancy and mendicity sprang from the innate qualities
of man, there would always have been vagrants and mendicants, which is not the case.
The appearance of these is due to the economic structure of society. It is not possible
to discuss this at length and the reader is referred to the work of Florian and Cavaglieri,
“<span lang="it">I vagabondi</span>” (I, Part One). These authors show that the first type of vagrant was the runaway
slave, and then the serf <span class="pageNum" id="pb563">[<a href="#pb563">563</a>]</span>who had fled from his lord’s domain. In the following periods the penalties with which
vagrants were threatened (and they were very severe) were especially designed to force
the proletariat to serve the purposes of the possessors of the means of production.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e57066src" href="#xd31e57066">380</a> In measure as the number of available workers increases and the proletariat submits
to the will of the capitalists, this cause becomes less important, and disappears
almost completely in our own time. It is rather the contrary that takes place, since
the army of vagrants and mendicants is now mainly composed of those who have not been
able to find work. Vagabondage and mendicity are at present punishable because of
the importunity of the mendicants, the losses experienced by persons living in the
country especially, and also because of the danger to society from the fact that the
dangerous criminals are partly recruited from this class.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before examining the motives inducing the commission of theft (the most important
crime of this group, the others being mostly modifications of it) we must first stop
a moment to ask the question, “Is honesty an innate characteristic or is it acquired?”
</p>
<p>In my opinion it is indisputable that honesty is as little innate as any other moral
conception.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e57087src" href="#xd31e57087">381</a> No child can distinguish between mine and thine, it is only little by little that
he gains this concept. On the contrary he has the tendency to monopolize everything
that he desires (the prehensory instinct, Lafargue names it).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e57104src" href="#xd31e57104">382</a> It is just this instinct that must be combated to make a child honest. It would,
therefore, be more correct to say that dishonesty is innate. Unless one takes account
of this fact it is impossible to give the etiology of theft and crimes of the same
nature.
</p>
<p>The motives for these crimes with which we are now occupied we shall speak of under
three heads. The first group includes the crimes committed from <i>poverty</i>, the second those that result from cupidity, and in the third group we shall treat
of the criminals by profession.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are some needs which a man must satisfy, without which his existence is impossible.
These are fundamental needs, independent of environment. If a man has not sufficient
food, if he has not (at least in non-tropical countries) clothing to protect him against
cold, if opportunity for rest is lacking, etc., his life is in danger. In our present
society there are always a number of persons who are in want of the strict necessaries
of life, and who are therefore obliged to steal if they do not wish to succumb to
poverty. It is evident that the word “poverty” is not to be taken in the most limited
sense, so that one who can still buy a morsel of bread, and yet steals, may still
be considered as a thief from poverty.
</p>
<p>We must make here one more observation before we enter upon the proofs of this thesis.
We have defined crime as an egoistic act. However, the same act may be at once egoistic
and altruistic, and this is the case with some crimes committed from poverty, when
an individual steals in order not to have those in his charge die of hunger. What
conflicts of duty our present society creates!
</p>
<p>The proofs that absolute poverty provokes a number of thefts are of three kinds. The
first two are based upon the dynamics of criminality.
</p>
<p>First. In winter, when poverty is most pressing, the number of thefts etc. is much
greater than in summer. This is a fact so well known that it is unnecessary to give
detailed proofs of it, and I think it will be sufficient to give the following statistics
dealing with two important countries for a great number of years.

<p>There is, then, a pretty considerable increase as winter approaches, and a decrease
with the summer months. I would call the attention of the reader especially to the
fact that it is the crimes of simple theft and the receiving of stolen goods which
show this change in the most marked way, while aggravated theft, embezzlement and
the professional and habitual receiving of stolen goods show it in less degree. It
is the two former crimes which have poverty as their cause, while the three latter
are more apt to be committed from cupidity and by professional criminals.

<p>We have here, then, as always, a great increase in fall and winter, and a corresponding
decrease in spring and summer.
</p>
<p>Second. A second proof of the importance of absolute poverty as a cause of crime etc.
is furnished by the fact that there is a considerable increase of the crimes in question
in times of economic depression (high price of bread, lack of work, etc.). In Part
One I have cited many works in which this phenomenon is proved for a number of countries.
I refer the reader, therefore, to the more important of these, and add other data
here.

upon the trend of economic crimes; now, in industrial countries like Germany, it is
rather the industrial situation, without, however, the price of cereals losing all
influence.<a class="noteRef" id="n568.1src" href="#n568.1">389</a>

<span class="pageNum" id="pb570a">[<a href="#pb570a">570</a>]</span></p>
<p>Few sociological theses, it seems to me, have been proved as conclusively as the one
of which we have just been speaking. The important influence of the trend of economic
events upon that of economic criminality has been shown for thirteen different countries
for different periods of the nineteenth century. Some authors are of the opinion that
poverty cannot be the cause of crimes that are committed when economic conditions
are most favorable, and when economic crimes have consequently reached their minimum.
This assertion still needs fuller proof, as I have already pointed out, since there
are still many persons who are in want of the necessaries of life even in times of
prosperity.
</p>
<p>I must say here a few words in answer to a final objection to the preceding observation;
namely, that the increase of theft etc., in times of economic depression, is, in great
part, a consequence, not of absolute poverty, but of the impossibility of satisfying
needs that have sprung up in more favorable times; and that the increase will be,
therefore, in large measure due to an increase of crimes committed from cupidity,
and not from poverty. This may be true in some cases, but not, in my opinion in the
great majority of cases, for the following reasons. When the economic situation is
favorable, when earnings are more than usual, and when, consequently, wants increase
and become more intense, can everyone satisfy the desires awakened in him by the spirit
of imitation? Surely not; even at such times of prosperity there are still many individuals
with whom desire is awakened but who are not able to satisfy it in a lawful manner.
On the other hand, wants in general diminish in times of crisis; cupidity is therefore
less excited, and with a limited income men are quite satisfied with having the means
of subsistence, when there are so many who lack the very necessaries of life. In my
opinion, crimes from cupidity increase rather than diminish in times of prosperity,
while in times of depression the opposite takes place. This cannot be proved for each
economic crime separately, since criminal statistics do not show whether a crime is
committed from poverty or cupidity. However, embezzlement, fraud, and aggravated theft
are committed in a greater degree from cupidity than is simple theft, (and by professional
criminals). Now statistics show that it is chiefly simple theft that follows the course
of economic events, the other crimes named doing so much less; the same is true of
the changes during the <span class="pageNum" id="pb571">[<a href="#pb571">571</a>]</span>different seasons. Finally, while absolute poverty in countries like Germany has decreased
and simple theft also, luxury and cupidity have increased, together with the other
crimes named.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58413src" href="#xd31e58413">394</a>
</p>
<p>The third proof that poverty is a great factor in the etiology of theft is the enormous
number of widows and divorced women who participate in these crimes (see pp. 452,
453). There is no reason to believe that these women are more covetous than married
women or spinsters; but it is certain that their economic situation is often very
burdensome.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58444src" href="#xd31e58444">395</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We shall not employ any further methods to establish our thesis; since for the reasons
already stated they would lead to results of no great significance, and it seems that
the accuracy of the thesis has been sufficiently shown by the proofs cited.
</p>
<p>We have now come to the end of our consideration of the subject of thefts committed
from poverty. There are two ways in which it is the cause of theft. On the one hand
it incites directly the appropriation of the property of others, and on the other
hand it exercises a demoralizing influence.

<h5 class="main"><span class="divNum"><i>b.</i></span> <span class="sc">THEFT COMMITTED FROM CUPIDITY.</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have now to deal with crimes of persons who steal neither from absolute poverty,
nor by profession. Those who are guilty of these crimes earn enough to satisfy their
more pressing needs, and they steal only when the occasion presents itself (whence
their name of occasional criminals)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58472src" href="#xd31e58472">396</a> in order to satisfy their desire for luxury.
</p>
<p>The first question, then, which must be answered here is this<span class="corr" id="xd31e58477" title="Source: ;">:</span> how do these needs arise? The answer can be brief; they are aroused by the environment.
In a society where some are rich, who have more income than is needed to supply the
fundamental necessities, and who create other needs for themselves, in such a society
the cupidity of those who have not similar incomes at their disposal will be <span class="pageNum" id="pb572">[<a href="#pb572">572</a>]</span>awakened. The desires which the criminals of whom we are speaking wish to satisfy
by their misdeeds are not different from those of the well-to-do. It goes without
saying that no one has ever desired any luxury that he has not seen someone else enjoying.
It would be a waste of time to discuss this. Every need that is not strictly necessary,
is not innate but acquired. If one has much, the other, an imitator, wants the same.
There is but one piece of advice to give to those who are not convinced of this simple
truth; that they read some ethnological works treating of peoples among whom there
are neither rich nor poor. They will then see that cupidity, with us a universal quality,
is there unknown.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58482src" href="#xd31e58482">397</a>
</p>
<p>The division between rich and poor is many centuries old and does not belong to capitalism
alone, although under capitalism the distance between the two has greatly increased
and is still increasing. The greater this distance is, the more, other things being
equal, cupidity increases.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58495src" href="#xd31e58495">398</a>
</p>
<p>The cupidity of those who can satisfy only the desire for the bare necessities is
not awakened in the same measure in each of them. As has already been remarked by
Guerry and Quetelet (see Part I), economic crimes are most numerous in the countries
where manufacturing and commerce are most developed, and where the contrasts of fortune
are consequently the greatest. It is for this reason that the cities, where the contrasts
between poverty and wealth are greatest, give also very high figures for crimes against
property (see pp. 530–531).
</p>
<p>Those who live in the same country or the same city are not, in spite of that, in
the same environment. Every great city has thousands of workers who, because of the
character of their labor, have no contact with luxury; others, on the contrary, have
the desire for luxury awakened in them by the fact that their work brings them in
touch with wealth. Hence it is, for example, that so large a number of economic crimes
are committed by workers occupied in commerce (see p. 446), and by servants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58507src" href="#xd31e58507">399</a> There are workmen who have never been accustomed to more than they are able to earn
at the time, but there are also those who have known better days and to whom the impossibility
of satisfying needs previously acquired is a constant source of suffering.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb573">[<a href="#pb573">573</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, the contrast between rich and poor is not the only cause of the origin of
cupidity. We must also sketch in addition to the above, especially the manner in which
commercial capital tries to draw buyers. The times are long gone by when the producer
worked principally to order. Modern industry manufactures enormous quantities of goods
without the outlet for them being known. The desire to buy must, then, be excited
in the public. Beautiful displays, dazzling illuminations, and many other means are
used to attain the desired end. The perfection of this system is reached in the great
modern retail store, where persons may enter freely, and see and handle everything,
where, in short, the public is drawn as a moth to a flame. The result of these tactics
is that the cupidity of the crowd is highly excited.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58519src" href="#xd31e58519">400</a>
</p>
<p>After what has been said it is unnecessary to dwell longer upon the different ways
in which cupidity is awakened in our present society. However we must note the following.
Almost all the thefts of the class of which we are speaking (those committed by so-called
occasional criminals) are thefts of articles of very small value (see the figures
on p. 201); the exceptions are the thefts of large sums of money. The authors of these
last are in general the employes of banks, etc., persons who, from the nature of their
work, have the opportunity to appropriate other people’s money. When we investigate
the reasons for their committing their misdeeds, we shall see that nine times out
of ten (I cannot prove it by figures, but no one will contradict me) the criminal
is a speculator who has lost, or perhaps an individual who visits prostitutes, and
hence has great need of money.
</p>
<p>Cupidity is thus excited by the environment, but not in the same degree in every case,
the environment not being the same for all. However, even supposing that the environment
were exactly identical for a number of persons, cupidity would not be excited in the
same measure in some as in others, since they are not alike, one being born with more
intense desires than others (admitting that it is the environment that calls forth
the desires). The more intense a man’s desires, the more risk he runs, other things
being equal, of falling foul of the law. As I have already remarked above, this is
important for the person who is seeking the reason why A and not B has stolen, though
both live in the same environment; for sociology this fact is only of <span class="pageNum" id="pb574">[<a href="#pb574">574</a>]</span>secondary importance, for it does not ask “<i>Who</i> becomes criminal?” but rather “<i>How</i> does it happen that there are crimes?”
</p>
<p>We have now examined one of the sides of the question; the principal cause of these
crimes is the cupidity awakened by the environment. If the environment were different,
cupidity would not be aroused and the crimes would not be committed. In my opinion
most criminologists do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of this fact. It
is very difficult for anyone who lives at ease to form an idea of what is passing
in the mind of one who has only the bare necessaries of life and is deprived of every
comfort and amusement, while he sees others who have too much, and yet often work
less than he does.
</p>
<p>Let us now examine the other side of the question. For this purpose let us make use
once more of the figure of balances in describing the process that goes on in the
brain of the man who hesitates. Upon one of the pans cupidity exercises its force,
in different measure according to the person. What are the weights upon the other
pan balancing the first? It is the moral forces which must be considered first. I
have fully explained above how the economic environment has prevented the social instincts
from being developed in man, and how this is especially true for certain classes of
persons. It is unnecessary to repeat this here. It will be sufficient to note certain
points which have a special importance for the kind of crimes with which we are occupied
at the moment.
</p>
<p>He who steals, prejudices the interests of another, does him harm, and at the same
time injures society, the existence of which would become impossible were theft permitted.
In my opinion, the present organization of society, of which the struggle of all against
all is the fundamental principle, has reduced this moral factor to very small dimensions.
In the economic domain each must be egoistic, for without egoism he would lose in
the struggle for existence. In the case of theft and similar crimes, those injured
are almost exclusively well-to-do persons, to whom the damage is disagreeable, but
who, in general do not suffer much. The thieves, on the other hand, are almost exclusively
persons who have to live on very little. How can we expect a poor man to take care
not to do a small injury to the rich for fear of causing them a little discomfort,
when most rich people are insensible to the suffering which without intermission,
overwhelms the poor. The present organization of society is responsible for the fact
that a slight sensibility to the misfortune of others offers only a trifling counterpoise
to the tendency to realize one’s desires in <span class="pageNum" id="pb575">[<a href="#pb575">575</a>]</span>a dishonest manner.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58575src" href="#xd31e58575">401</a> The idea that society in itself is injured by theft cannot constitute any considerable
counterpoise, since he who violates the eighth commandment cannot feel himself at
one with a society which never has helped him when he was in difficulties.
</p>
<p>After this general observation let us pass on to particular remarks that apply to
certain classes of persons only. How does it happen that a great proportion of mankind
are honest? To this question the answer must be, “because they have been accustomed
to it from infancy.” The opposite also is true; a great number of thieves are such
because any moral education was out of the question in the environment in which they
were brought up. They satisfy their “prehensory instinct” without being conscious
of any ill-doing. With these the balance inclines to the side of dishonesty, unless
a counterpoise of some magnitude is found. Above (pp. 489 <i>ff.</i>) we have seen that most criminals, especially thieves, come from a totally corrupt
environment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58594src" href="#xd31e58594">402</a>
</p>
<p>This does not apply to another category of thieves; those who do not proceed from
an absolutely corrupt environment—yet whose surroundings are not good and wholesome.
Ferriani<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58608src" href="#xd31e58608">403</a> and Aschaffenburg<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58612src" href="#xd31e58612">404</a> go so far as to say that almost every child has once stolen something. This may be
a little exaggerated but it certainly has truth at the bottom of it. If the child
has no one to take the trouble to teach him that he ought not to steal, it is more
than likely that he will have to answer for theft later (occasional theft is committed
by children and minors especially). It is true that all the children whose <span class="pageNum" id="pb576">[<a href="#pb576">576</a>]</span>education has been defective do not become thieves, nor even the majority of them;
there are those for whom a single prohibition will be enough to make them respect
the property of others for the rest of their lives. There are others of them, weak
characters who, notwithstanding such prohibition, cannot resist when the temptation
is strong. If their education had been good, the environment in which they were brought
up more favorable, they would not have had to be turned over to justice. Hear the
opinion of one of those most competent to judge of the matter, Raux, who, having put
to himself the question whether the young people detained in the “<span lang="fr">Quartier <span class="corr" id="xd31e58622" title="Source: correctionel">correctionnel</span></span>” of Lyons have a real tendency to steal, answers as follows. “Evidently not. Without
entering into the analysis of the circumstances which provoke crime, we shall give,
in support of our assertion, an observation as simple as conclusive. Young prisoners
condemned for theft have shown us upon different occasions a probity, a most praiseworthy
disinterestedness, in the presence of things that they might have appropriated without
exposing themselves to any reproof.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58625src" href="#xd31e58625">405</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We might close our observations upon theft from cupidity at this point if there were
not fear of an objection drawn from what has just been said, namely the following.
If the occasional thief has become such, on the one side because of the cupidity awakened
in him, and on the other side in consequence of his lack of a good education, and
if he differs, not qualitatively, but only quantitatively from the honest man, possessing
less strength of character than the average—if all this is true, then the figures
for theft should be higher than the statistics show. All of which would go to prove
that it is wrong to deny that criminals constitute a biological anomaly.
</p>
<p>Here is my reply. First. Moral forces do not constitute the only counterpoise to the
tendency toward theft. Since the moral check often lacks efficacy, another has been
created which acts in the same way to turn the egoist away from crime, namely the
fear inspired by the possibility of punishment. Any one would be credulous indeed
to fancy that those who have an opportunity to steal and do not profit by it are deterred
by moral forces. Without punishment criminality would be much more extensive than
it now is. Where the danger of being found out is not great, the number of transgressions
is enormous (think, for example, of the cases of smuggling).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58635src" href="#xd31e58635">406</a>
</p>
<p>Second. Many persons remain honest, not for moral reasons, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb577">[<a href="#pb577">577</a>]</span>because they lack the courage, cleverness, or other qualities necessary for being
otherwise, qualities which in themselves have nothing to do with crime.
</p>
<p>Third. Still others remain honest for reasons based upon mature reflection. They find
that it is too dangerous to commit an offense, but do not hesitate in the presence
of acts <i>essentially</i> criminal, although they do not fall under the ban of the law.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58657src" href="#xd31e58657">407</a> No one is ignorant of this, and only certain anthropologists who examine no one but
prisoners, have lost sight of it.
</p>
<p>Those who compose the criminal world are by nature very diverse. Some are the most
dangerous individuals that it is possible to imagine, others are rather weak than
wicked. Among these last are ranged the occasional criminals, who, taken together,
form a danger to society, but taken singly are not dangerous men in the strict sense.
Leuss, who learned to know prisoners, not as judge, or as medical expert, but as a
prisoner himself, says: “The great mass of prisoners are more <span class="corr" id="xd31e58677" title="Source: good natured">good-natured</span> than the average man; the good-nature of thieves corresponds with their weakness
of will, that invincible obstacle to their maintaining themselves in the world of
industry. Stress must constantly be laid upon the fact that these weak-willed, good-natured
persons are the ones who swell the number of crimes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58680src" href="#xd31e58680">408</a>
</p>
<p>When we place beside the occasional thieves, those who never steal but commit all
sorts of reprehensible (though not illegal) acts, the comparison is not to the advantage
of the latter. Their trickery, their pitiless egoism, often make them more dangerous
to society than the others; which should be a reason for criminal anthropology not
to build a system based solely upon investigations of prisoners.
</p>
<p>Fourth. Finally many more crimes are committed than are mentioned by criminal statistics.
Although I have already spoken of this (p. 84), I must return to it. In the first
place, most criminal statistics give the figures only for those convicted. Those acquitted
have no place, although, with few exceptions, a crime has nevertheless been committed.
We know that the number of acquittals is very considerable. In Germany, there were
15 to 20 acquittals to 100 cases tried (1882–1896);<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58689src" href="#xd31e58689">409</a> in Italy the number of acquittals ran as high as 51.37% (1890–1895).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58695src" href="#xd31e58695">410</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb578">[<a href="#pb578">578</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the second place, in many cases the prosecution is postponed for different reasons,
with the result that there is neither an acquittal nor a condemnation. Then a great
many cases never come to trial because justice cannot discover the authors of the
crimes. In Germany, for example, of all the cases on the dockets in the criminal courts
between 1881 and 1891, only 43 to 45% actually came before the judges.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58704src" href="#xd31e58704">411</a> During the period between 1886 and 1890, the examining judges dismissed on an average
8900 cases, either because the author of the crime was unknown, or because the proof
was insufficient. During the same period and for the same reasons, 98,741 cases on
the average were not prosecuted by the authorities.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58714src" href="#xd31e58714">412</a> The authors of about 25% of the crimes committed in Italy remained unknown (1887–1894).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58724src" href="#xd31e58724">413</a>
</p>
<p>These two reasons by themselves show that the number of crimes is much greater than
the statistics would generally lead one to suppose, even if one takes account of the
fact that some of the complaints made to the prosecutors are false.
</p>
<p>In the third place, we have been speaking so far of the cases that come to the notice
of the officers, while in a great number of cases no complaint is made, especially
in the matter of petty theft, either because the person injured wishes to avoid the
annoyance of having to appear in the police court as witness, or because he wishes
to spare the delinquent.
</p>
<p>In the fourth place, a great many small thefts remain unknown even to the person injured,
since he does not notice the loss that he has suffered.
</p>
<p>All this goes to show that crime, taken in the strict sense, and especially theft,
is much more extensive than one would expect at first, and the objection that might
have been made to my thesis is hence without weight. It is evident that the number
of criminals unpunished cannot be fixed with certainty. Dr. Puibaraud places it at
50%;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58740src" href="#xd31e58740">414</a> while Tarde believes that it is greater;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58746src" href="#xd31e58746">415</a> Yvernès, the well-known French statistician, says that 90% of the professional thieves
remain unknown, and Dr. Thomsen, from whom I take this <span class="pageNum" id="pb579">[<a href="#pb579">579</a>]</span>last fact, says that this applies to other <span class="corr" id="xd31e58759" title="Source: cateogries">categories</span> of criminals also.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58762src" href="#xd31e58762">416</a> However this may be the number in any case is very considerable.
</p>
<p>To sum up. I believe I have shown that the fundamental causes of theft and similar
crimes committed from cupidity are, on the one hand, the cupidity aroused by the environment
and, on the other, neglected childhood among the poor. It is especially those weak
in character who run the greatest risk of becoming guilty of these crimes.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In considering all the kinds of theft and analogous crimes, we note that the thefts
committed by professional criminals represent only a minority. But as soon as we limit
our consideration to the more serious forms of theft, such as burglary and similar
crimes, we shall discover that they are committed almost exclusively by individuals
whose principal or subsidiary occupation is theft, and who, in general, do not consider
it shameful, and do not feel the slightest repentance.
</p>
<p>The question arises, how it is possible for anyone to embrace so abject a profession,
and thus become so harmful a parasite.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58790src" href="#xd31e58790">417</a> There are authors who would have us believe that there are persons who have chosen
crime from pleasure in it. As Leuss observes in his work, “<span lang="de">Aus dem Zuchthause</span>”, this opinion is so absurd that it would be a waste of time to consider it. No one
of sound mind could possibly prefer so abominable a profession, and one so full of
risks from the point of view of simple calculation. There must be other reasons for
the existence of such persons.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58843src" href="#xd31e58843">418</a> If we wish to examine these causes we must divide professional criminals into separate
groups.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb580a">[<a href="#pb580a">580</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first category is composed of children. Sad as this is it is none the less true.
It is plain that not a single child follows the profession of thief from pleasure,
for a child prefers not to work at all. These children, then, are taught to steal
by their parents. If they are not very numerous, in the great cities there are always
some cases of this kind. Dr. Puibaraud, former police official in Paris, describes
one of these as follows. “We recall that one day, on visiting the Petite-Roquette,
we found in a cell a child scarcely eight years old, with a wide-awake face, a quick
eye, but whose physiognomy was already very peculiar. It was a young pickpocket who
had been found drunk upon the street, and who, being arrested by an agent and taken
to the station, had confessed that the gold he had in his possession was the proceeds
of a theft committed by him without the knowledge of his ‘papa.’ This capture ended
by the whole family’s being <span class="corr" id="xd31e58854" title="Source: arested">arrested</span> at their lodgings, near the Place Maubert.
</p>
<p>“This gamin was very intelligent and gave the following account of himself, which
was corroborated by what was brought out in the examination. ‘My father showed me
how to pick pockets, but so far I have only “done” ladies because that is easier.
With gentlemen you may touch their leg when you stick your hand in their pocket and
they turn round, and that’s no joke! With ladies you do not get so close and they
do not feel your hand. It isn’t hard at all. Papa taught me well. We went every day
together to the Palais Royal and Place de la Bastille omnibus stations. The Palais
Royal is no good. The best is the Madeleine, but Mother G. works that and she quarrels
with papa. We don’t go there any more. Last week papa told me to wait for him at the
Palais Royal omnibus stand. He didn’t come, and, “<span lang="fr">ma foi!</span>” I went to work by myself. I got a purse from an old lady. There were sixty francs
in it. I drank a bit and then I was arrested.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58862src" href="#xd31e58862">419</a>
</p>
<p>As we see this child found theft the most natural thing in the world (and any other
child in the same environment would think the same); he “worked” with his father.
If exceptionally favorable circumstances do not happen to present themselves to such
children they will belong to the army of professional criminals all their lives.
</p>
<p>Now, as for the others, those who have not been brought up for a life of crime, yet
practice it as their profession—how can we explain <span class="pageNum" id="pb581">[<a href="#pb581">581</a>]</span>their manner of life? The answer to this question can be found only in the works of
those who have familiarized themselves with the life of criminals, and who have lived
in their midst in order to know them (like Flynt, for example), or who are in a position,
because of their profession, to study them in detail, and become their confidants
(like the well-known almoners of the Grande-Roquette: Crozes, Moreau, and Faure).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58886src" href="#xd31e58886">420</a>
</p>
<p>Except for a few subsidiary circumstances the life of the professional criminal may
be summed up as follows. With very rare exceptions he springs from a corrupt environment,
perhaps having lost his parents while still very young, or having even been abandoned
by them. Being misled by bad company, he commits an “occasional” theft while still
a child, for which he must pay the penalty of an imprisonment; he may, at times owe
his entrance into prison to a non-economic misdeed. This, however, is a very rare
exception.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58909src" href="#xd31e58909">421</a> As we have remarked above, prison never improves him, and generally makes him worse.
If he is in contact with the other prisoners, among whom there are naturally a number
of out and out criminals, he hears the recital of their adventurous life, learns their
tricks and all that he still needs to know to be thoroughly informed as to “the profession.”
Nor will the separate cell be any more profitable to him, brutalized as he already
is by his earlier environment. Then after a certain time he is set at liberty and
returned to society. The partisans of free will say that he has expiated his fault
and can now commence a new life.
</p>
<p>That is easy to say, and certainly justice will not concern itself with him any further
until he commits a new offense. But this is not the same as saying that society pardons
him and aids him, in order that he may remain in the right path. On the contrary,
forgetting that we must forgive those who have trespassed against us, society makes
life hard for him. It is almost impossible for him to find work; the fact that he
has been in prison is enough to insure his being refused everywhere. Why should anyone
hire an old prisoner when there are so many others who have never got into the courts?
And then <span class="pageNum" id="pb582">[<a href="#pb582">582</a>]</span>most prisoners have never learned a trade, and this is one reason more why they cannot
easily find employment. The liberated convict becomes a nomad, begins by losing all
contact with the normal world (supposing he ever had any) and feels himself a social
pariah. On the other hand he has relations more and more frequent with the “under
world”, with those who recognize no duty toward a society which is not interested
in their fate. His moral sense comes to be more and more blunted until he becomes
a criminal by profession, having a feeling neither of shame nor of repentance.
</p>
<p>The ignorant public, who know nothing about the professional criminal except when
he appears before the tribunal, is astonished to find that there are persons so abject.
This astonishment is like that of some one who has never seen a house built, and cannot
imagine how such a colossus can be put up. But he who has seen how the house has been
erected by adding one small brick to another no longer feels any astonishment. It
is the same with the professional criminal; he who has followed the story of the criminal’s
life recognizes with Dr. Havelock Ellis, that his crime is but the last link of a
solidly forged chain.
</p>
<p>Generally the professional criminal does not give the least sign of repentance. He
does as much injury to society as he can, without having any shame about it. Yet he
is not entirely deprived of moral sense, only it extends merely to those who are really
his fellows. All the tales of the world of professional criminals which depict them
as void of all sense of duty toward their fellows, proceed rather from the imagination
of the authors than from facts really observed. The only competent authors are those
who have been able to study the criminal <i>in his own environment</i>, and not in prison, where his true character makes itself known as little as that
of an animal in a cage. Hear the opinion of Flynt, for example. “It is often said
that his (the professional criminal’s) lack of remorse for his crimes proves him to
be morally incompetent; but this opinion is formed on insufficient knowledge of his
life. He has two systems of morality: one for his business and the other for the hang-out.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58932src" href="#xd31e58932">422</a> There follows the description of the relations existing between him and society of
which we have already spoken, after which the author continues as follows.
</p>
<p>“In the bosom of his hang-out, however—and this is where we ought to study his ethics,—he
is a very different man. His code of morals there will compare favorably with that
of any class of society; and there is no class in which fair dealing is more seriously
preached, <span class="pageNum" id="pb583">[<a href="#pb583">583</a>]</span>and unfair dealing more severely condemned. The average criminal will stand by a fellow-craftsman
through thick and thin; and the only human being he will not tolerate is the one who
turns traitor. The remorse of this traitor when brought to bay by his former brethren
I have never seen exceeded anywhere.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58941src" href="#xd31e58941">423</a>
</p>
<p>After expatiating upon this subject, Flynt continues: “It is thought by criminologists
that the good fellowship of the criminal is due to self-preservation and the fear
that each man will hang separately if all do not hang together. They maintain that
his good feeling is not genuine and spontaneous emotion, and that it is immaterial
what happens to a ‘pal’ so long as he himself succeeds. This is not my experience
in his company. He has never had the slightest intimation that I would return favors
that he did me; and in the majority of instances he has had every reason to know that
it was not in my power to show him the friendliness he wanted. Yet he has treated
me with an altruism that even a Tolstoi might admire. At the hang-out I have been
hospitably entertained on all occasions; and I have never met a criminal there who
would not have given me money or seen me through a squabble, had I needed his assistance
and he was able to give it. This same comradeship is noticeable in all his relations
with men who are in the least connected with his life and business; and it is notorious
fact that he will ‘divvy’ his last meal with a pal. To have to refuse the request
of one of his fellows, or to do him an unkindness, is as much regretted by the criminal
as by anyone else; and I have never known him to tell me a lie or to cheat me or to
make fun of me behind my back.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58947src" href="#xd31e58947">424</a>
</p>
<p>This is altogether different from what is generally said and written by those who
allow themselves to be led away by their imagination. It is plain that the manner
in which criminals act toward a society that is hostile to them will not fail to influence
the relations they have with their fellows, just as war for those who take part in
it cannot leave their moral sense as regards their compatriots unharmed. However,
nothing permits us to put the actions of these persons among themselves in the same
rank as those towards society. In my opinion this fact has great significance for
the moralist and the criminologist; it is one of the forms of the dualism of ethics.
It is of very high importance for the criminologist, for its shows that we are upon
the wrong track, since it is precisely the more serious forms of crime that the present
methods of repression favor.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb584">[<a href="#pb584">584</a>]</span></p>
<p>In imprisoning young people who have committed merely misdemeanors of minor importance,
and who have not yet lost all touch with normal society, and putting them in contact
with inveterate criminals, or perhaps putting them into a cage like beasts, without
striving to enlighten their darkened minds or teach them morality, and without making
them capable of sustaining the struggle for existence by teaching them a trade, we
are bringing up professional criminals. Punishment, as a means of intimidation, misses
its aim in great part, for the professional criminals are recruited among individuals
who are not easily intimidated.
</p>
<p>We have now come to the question why a certain number only of those whose childhood
has been neglected and who have committed a light offense, become professional criminals.
In the first place there are those whom chance favors, since they are assisted, it
may be by their families, it may be by some philanthropist, and so return to the right
path. There are those also who have the advantage of being able to find work, since
no one knows that they have been in prison.
</p>
<p>Others have less chance; no one aids them, there is no work for them; all, however,
do not become professional thieves. Those who become such are the more intelligent,
energetic, ambitious, and courageous of these outcasts; the others become vagrants
and mendicants. Here is the opinion of Flynt upon the criminal by profession, an opinion
which agrees with that of other competent authors. “I must say … that those criminals
who are known to me are not, as is also popularly supposed, the scum of their environment.
On the contrary, they are above their environment, and are often gifted with talents
which would enable them to do well in any class, could they only be brought to realize
its responsibilities and to take advantage of its opportunities. The notion that the
criminal is the lowest type of his class arises from a false conception of that class
and of the people who compose it.…
</p>
<p>“In this same class, however, there are some who are born with ambitions, and who
have energy enough to try to fulfil them. These break away from class conditions;
but unfortunately, the ladder of respectable business has no foothold in their environment.…
</p>
<p>“Not all of these ambitious ones are endowed with an equal amount of energy. Some
are capable only of tramp life, which, despite its many trials and vicissitudes, is
more attractive than the life they seek to escape. Those with greater energy go into
crime proper; and they may be called, mentally as well as physically, the aristocracy
<span class="pageNum" id="pb585">[<a href="#pb585">585</a>]</span>of their class. This is my analysis of the majority of the criminal men and women
I have encountered in the open, and I believe it will hold good throughout their entire
class.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58966src" href="#xd31e58966">425</a>
</p>
<p>There are readers, perhaps, who will find that these qualities of the professional
criminal give the lie to the environment hypothesis, since individual factors are
recognized in a certain way. For myself I do not find it so. The qualities mentioned
have nothing to do with crime as such; they can be utilized to the profit as well
as to the detriment of society; it will depend upon the environment in which the individual
endowed with them has been raised what direction he will take. It would not be difficult
to name a number of historic celebrities (Napoleon, for example) who, if they had
been born in the lower stratum of a great city, in place of in a favorable environment,
would have had only the sad celebrity of criminals exceptionally endowed.
</p>
<p>The psychology of this kind of criminals is not yet complete however. Besides intelligence,
energy, and courage we find cupidity as their great characteristic.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e58989src" href="#xd31e58989">426</a> They see others who can enjoy themselves without working hard, and it is their ambition
to do the same, cost what it may. Since fate has made it impossible for them to attain
it honestly they risk another method. This type of criminal is well delineated in
the remark made by the notorious Lemaire, when he said to the president of the court:
“If I were a property owner, I should not be here.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59001src" href="#xd31e59001">427</a>
</p>
<p>To have invested funds, to spend plenty of money, not to have to work much, this is
their ideal; to share the lot of the working-man, who, notwithstanding his long and
hard labor, never succeeds in procuring for himself the pleasures of the rich, makes
life insipid in their eyes. M. Gisquet, former prefect of police, gives in his memoirs
the following declaration made by Leblanc, the notorious professional criminal. “If
I were not a thief by vocation I should become one by calculation; it is the best
profession. I have computed the good and bad chances of all the others, and I am convinced
by the comparisons that there is none more favorable or more independent than that
of thief, nor one that does not offer at least an equal amount of danger.
</p>
<p>“What should I have become in the society of honest men? <span class="pageNum" id="pb586">[<a href="#pb586">586</a>]</span>A natural child, with no one to protect me or to recommend me, I could only choose
a disagreeable trade, become a delivery-boy in a store, or at most reach the miserable
place of shipping clerk in a warehouse; and there, a supernumerary for many years,
I should have died of hunger before I reached a salary of six hundred francs. As a
workman in any class whatever you exhaust yourself quickly through the fatigues of
your labor, to earn a miserable wage, and to live from day to day; then when accident,
sickness, or old age come you must go beg or die in the poorhouse.…
</p>
<p>“In our condition we depend only on ourselves; and if we acquire skill and experience
at least they profit ourselves alone. I know very well that we have risks to run,
that the police and the courts are at hand, that the prison is not very far distant;
but out of eight thousand thieves in Paris, you never have more than seven or eight
hundred in jail; that is not a tenth of the whole. We enjoy, then, on the average,
nine years of liberty to one in prison. Well, where is the worker who has not a dead
season? Besides, what does he do when he is without work? He carries his possessions
to the Mont-de-Piété; while we others, if we are free, lack for nothing; our existence
is a continual round of feasting and pleasure.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59021src" href="#xd31e59021">428</a>
</p>
<p>This is the type of the perfect egoist. In ranking men according to their social sentiments,
such an individual would be put at the very lowest point in the scale. And then he
has grown up under unfavorable circumstances (illegitimate birth, etc.). The innate
egoism of this individual may perhaps be modified by the individual factor. But this
in no way diminishes the truth of the environment hypothesis, for we are treating
for the moment the question why this <i>particular individual</i> has become a criminal, and not that of the cause of the existence of professional
criminals. And these two questions are far from being identical. The existence of
individual differences is the reason why one <i>runs more danger</i> of becoming a professional criminal than another; but it is the environment which
brings it about that the predisposed individual <i>actually</i> becomes such. The falsity of the environment hypothesis would be demonstrated if
such individuals could be proved to become criminals <i>under all circumstances</i>. This is of course not the case. When individuals like these are not brought up in
an atmosphere of poverty, they no longer see on the one side persons who enjoy everything
while doing nothing, and on the other side those who, while toiling hard, live in
poverty,—they will not <span class="pageNum" id="pb587">[<a href="#pb587">587</a>]</span>become examples of altruism indeed, but they will not become guilty of crime. They
may even become very useful members of society, since they are generally more largely
endowed with intelligence, energy, and courage than the average man. Rightly exercised,
these qualities are very useful; but badly directed they are very harmful to society.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59043src" href="#xd31e59043">429</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>So far we have been treating of the etiology of theft and analogous crimes; we shall
conclude this section with some observations upon the causes that have led to the
designating of these acts as crime.
</p>
<p>Theft is a crime only because it is very harmful to society.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59076src" href="#xd31e59076">430</a> If in the majority of cases the individual does not take account of this, the assertion
is nevertheless true. Everything that is harmful to society the individual considers
as immoral. (<i>Why</i> this is so is a psychological question, with which we are not concerned here.) If
we picture to ourselves present-day society, based as it is upon exchange, without
the strict prohibition of theft, we shall see that it could not possibly exist. Life
would be especially impossible in a society where the division of labor has attained
a high degree of development, if it were permissible to take anything without giving
an equivalent.
</p>
<p>Since the human race has existed there has been private property, however trifling
and unimportant it may have been. It is therefore very unlikely that theft has ever
been permitted<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59093src" href="#xd31e59093">431</a> (it is impossible to produce proofs in support of this), since it is difficult to
imagine that anyone would consent to see himself stripped of things destined for his
own use, to which, further he was more or less attached.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59112src" href="#xd31e59112">432</a> But there is a great difference between a prohibited act and a crime. It is proved
that among primitive peoples theft is not reckoned among the crimes. Hear the opinion
of one of the greatest specialists in this field, Dr. Post. “We find here and there
a phenomenon very surprising from our modern point of view, namely that theft is not
universally regarded as a misdemeanor, but the thief rather respected <span class="pageNum" id="pb588">[<a href="#pb588">588</a>]</span>for his cleverness. The maximum obligation that a theft lays upon the thief is simple
restitution of the stolen property. The consequence of theft is thus simply the duty
of restitution under the civil law.… Theft lies entirely outside of the province of
criminal law.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59123src" href="#xd31e59123">433</a>
</p>
<p>It is not difficult to explain the cause of this. Let the reader picture to himself
the primitive forms of society, so different from those we have at present; contrasts
of possessions were unknown, and the needs of men consequently less numerous; men
produced only for their own consumption and not for exchange. If by chance more was
produced than was needed, the surplus was given to others, for it was impossible to
exchange it, or to preserve it for any great length of time, the necessary technique
for this not having yet been acquired. “The law of hospitality” was universal and
enjoined men to provide those in need with whatever they lacked.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59147src" href="#xd31e59147">434</a> It is quite comprehensible that at such a stage of development theft should not be
in evidence, for the motives which drive men to it would be lacking. On the one hand
cupidity was not awakened, and theft did not result from absolute poverty, since if
there was poverty the whole group suffered together.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59151src" href="#xd31e59151">435</a> On the other hand the social instincts, being highly developed by the environment,
constituted a restraint that would prevent the execution of a theft if the thought
of it should occur. But even supposing that in such a society a theft, for no matter
what cause, should nevertheless be committed, it would be little thought of, and certainly
the thief would not be severely punished, for his act would not be very harmful to
society.
</p>
<p>As the social structure changed the ideas about theft changed equally; with the origin
of the system of exchange and of the contrasts of property, came powerful motives
for theft, and at the same time the social instincts grew weaker. Thus theft came
to be considered a more serious matter than before, and the graded system of punishments
for it, beginning with a fine, ended in capital punishment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59164src" href="#xd31e59164">436</a> It is not our task to investigate the reason why the punishment for theft has not
always been the same during the whole civilized period; <span class="pageNum" id="pb589">[<a href="#pb589">589</a>]</span>it is enough for us to establish the fact that the act has always been considered
as a grave offense, the perpetrator of which incurred severe penalties.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the figures reproduced above (pp. 535–542) have shown, the crimes with which we
have now to concern ourselves are relatively rare. It is unnecessary to say that this
has not always been so, but that there have been great changes in this regard. At
one time robbery and similar acts of violence were the ordinary forms of professional
crime. Happily for peaceable folk this is no longer the case; these crimes have been
in large measure replaced by others less serious, like theft and fraud.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59201src" href="#xd31e59201">437</a> All modern states have not reached the same stage of development, nor all parts of
the same state. There are those of them that, more than others, recall the past to
us. So is it in regard to their criminality. While robbery may be said to have disappeared
from the states of northern Europe, it is still very common in a country like Italy,
and is met much less frequently in the modernized provinces of northern Italy than
in the backward southern provinces, as the following figures show.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59213src" href="#xd31e59213">438</a>

<p>According to the figures given by Dr. Bosco, in the United States, also, the most
backward states give the highest figures for homicide.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59370src" href="#xd31e59370">439</a>
</p>
<p>The poorer classes have more resemblance to the people of a bygone day than have the
well-to-do; it appears from the statistics (see pp. 438 <i>ff.</i>) that economic criminality takes a more violent form among the former than among
the latter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59384src" href="#xd31e59384">440</a>
</p>
<p>An investigation into the causes of this change in the form of economic criminality
will indicate also the principal causes of the persistent existence of this kind of
crime, however it may have decreased in modern times. In my opinion these causes are
as follows:
</p>
<p>First. The opportunity for committing them presented itself more often formerly, since
the means of communication were very primitive, travelers had to traverse uninhabited
countries, etc., and in addition the states were not so well organized as at present,
and had not the means of suppressing bands of brigands vigorously.
</p>
<p>Second. While the opportunity to commit violent economic crimes successfully was diminishing,
there was a constantly increasing opportunity to commit other economic crimes, such
as theft, embezzlement, and fraud. The accumulation of great wealth in the cities,
the development of credit, in short, the enormous extension of capitalism, has multiplied
the opportunity for economic crimes without violence.
</p>
<p>Third. One of the consequences of the development of society has been the gradual
diminution of the importance of the rôle played by violence, and, since criminality
presents itself always and everywhere under the same forms as the normal life, violent
economic criminality has also commenced to form a smaller and smaller part in the
totality of economic crimes. The assertion that violence has lost the importance of
its rôle upon the human stage might surprise one, and appear ironical in times like
ours when war is the chronic condition, when the military preparations of all the
states have reached a degree hitherto unknown. Violence, however, has decreased in
so far as it is exercised by the individual as such. The greater becomes the centralization
of the state, the more it claims for itself the exclusive right to use violence in
the cases where it judges it necessary, and the more it prohibits individual acts
of violence.
</p>
<p>It is not the development of the state that is alone to be considered in this regard;
the economic system enters in also. Under capitalism <span class="pageNum" id="pb591">[<a href="#pb591">591</a>]</span>violence is of no use; he who is master of the means of production attains his end,
<i>i.e.</i> makes a profit, without the use of violence. Where it is necessary, however, modern
man does not recoil from it, as the wars of expansion prove.
</p>
<p>Fourth. Civilization (in the proper sense of the word) has become more general. Formerly
the privilege of a few only, it now extends to a greater number. The great mass are
still deprived of it, but primary instruction contributes to its development.
</p>
<p>When we consider the gradual diminution in the number of economic crimes committed
with violence, it clearly appears how false is the notion that anyone committing such
a crime is for that reason a <i>biologically</i> abnormal being. Will anyone claim that the number of biologically abnormal persons
has constantly diminished? The contrary is much more likely.
</p>
<p>We need not concern ourselves with the details of this question, since it has already
been thoroughly treated by Professor Manouvrier (see Pt. I of this work, pp. 168–171).
He who uses violence to attain an economic end may perhaps, physiologically considered,
be a perfectly normal man. How many children are there who do not use force to take
a toy from a weaker child? Must we class them as abnormal on that account? And are
those who voluntarily take part in a war abnormal? Certainly there is a great difference
between those who take part in a war, and those who, for economic reasons, commit
a crime, but this difference is of a <i>social</i> nature. Our ideas of war and homicide are not the same, but the act of killing one’s
neighbor remains identical. If homicide were the evident proof of biological abnormality
the soldier also would be abnormal.
</p>
<p>Scientific questions can be solved by reason alone, and not by sentiment. We who experience
a profound repulsion at the thought of a murderer, hold him for a being apart, since
we feel ourselves so remote from him. Scientific research tells us that this feeling
is not innate but acquired, for we detest such acts because the environment in which
we live has accustomed us to hate them. If our environment were different, our feelings
would likewise be different. Besides, war proves that these feelings are not innate,
by hardening the mildest persons in a very brief time.
</p>
<p>With time the number of persons who have a horror of violence has increased. Does
this prove that men have become better, or simply that they feel a repugnance to the
act only and not to its effect? J.&nbsp;J. Rousseau once said: “If, in order to fall heir
to the property of a rich mandarin living at the farthest confines of China, whom
one had <span class="pageNum" id="pb592">[<a href="#pb592">592</a>]</span>never seen or heard spoken of, it were enough to push a button to make him die, which
of us would not push that button?”
</p>
<p>It is certain that beside a great number of persons who would not wish to charge their
consciences with such a crime, there would also be plenty who would commit it, and
their number would be great enough to make the order of mandarins pass into legendary
history. There is no reason to suppose that there are fewer persons in our day who
would commit such acts, than formerly; if men are no longer as violent as they once
were, they do not recoil any more than formerly when it is a question of suppressing,
through the agency of a third party, those who oppose them; as witness the wars of
expansion.
</p>
<p>As the motives of these crimes are the same as those of economic crimes without violence,
we shall treat first those that are caused by poverty; secondly, those that are committed
from cupidity; and thirdly, those that are the work of professional criminals.
</p>
<p>Statistics show that a part of the economic crimes of violence are committed from
poverty, for their movement is influenced by the fluctuations of economic conditions.
We take from the German criminal statistics the following table of the course of these
crimes in the different months of the year.

(The slight increase from April to August, which appears also in the case of a number
of other economic crimes, I am unable to explain.)
</p>
<p>As we have seen in the statistics in Part One, the economic situation also exercises

<p>Although there are exceptions, the influence of the price of grain makes itself felt.
It should be remarked that the years 1889–1892 were years of crisis.
</p>
<p class="subheading">France, 1825–1882.
</p>
<p>In his study “<span lang="fr">De la criminalité en France et en Italie</span>” Dr. Bournet shows that in the period mentioned the maxima of assassinations coincide
with the years of economic crises, namely: 1839, 1840, 1843, 1844, 1847, 1867, 1876,
and 1881.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59726src" href="#xd31e59726">443</a> It should be remarked that assassinations are committed not simply from economic
motives, but for other reasons, whence it follows that the parallelism cannot be as
great as in the case of economic crimes that are not committed from other motives.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy, 1873–1890.
</p>
<p>Dr. Fornasari proves that economic events have a great influence upon these crimes
(see Part One, p. 143).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb594">[<a href="#pb594">594</a>]</span></p>
<p class="subheading">Prussia, 1854–1896.
</p>
<p>Dr. Starke (see Part One, p. 64) and Dr<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Müller (see pp. 76–78) have proved that the changes of economic conditions are here
also cause of an increase or diminution of these crimes.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Although these data are less numerous than we might desire, they show sufficiently
that, in part, violent economic crimes are committed because of poverty.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59744src" href="#xd31e59744">444</a>
</p>
<p>Above I have shown how it happens that only some of those who live in absolute poverty
commit crime. We have only, then, to ask ourselves why one commits a crime with violence
and the other without violence. The causes are of different kinds. Oftenest it is
chance, <i>i.e.</i> opportunity, that is the cause. No one uses violence if it is not necessary, and
since the opportunity of committing a successful theft is much greater than that of
committing an economic crime with violence, it is the first that is most often practiced.
Those who, when driven by abject poverty, commit an economic crime with violence,
when the opportunity presents itself, are persons who lack neither the force nor the
courage necessary, and in whom the environment in which they live has not inspired
a great aversion to violence. Further, absolute poverty is so powerful a factor that
it often neutralizes the important influences of education and environment.
</p>
<p><i>From cupidity.</i> The class of criminals who use violence or commit a homicide from cupidity is very
small. They furnish only a minor part of violent economic crimes, the total number
of which is not itself very great. To show how far the influence of economic environment
goes I will cite some striking cases taken at random.
</p>
<p>First. In 1892 a certain Scheffer was convicted at Linz (Austria) of attempted murder.
His crime was the following. He and his wife could earn their living only by working
hard. Chance brought a change. One of their relatives, a young girl who had lost her
father and mother a short time before, came to live with them. The girl being very
rich, the condition of the Scheffers was entirely changed; from then on they could
live in abundance. Once habituated to this wealth they were filled with the fear that
their relative would marry and the money pass to someone else. Little by little the
idea came to them of persuading the girl to make a will in their favor, and then killing
her, an idea which they rejected at first, but which nevertheless <span class="pageNum" id="pb595">[<a href="#pb595">595</a>]</span>became stronger and stronger. From unforeseen circumstances the crime was never consummated,
but stopped in the attempt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59765src" href="#xd31e59765">445</a>
</p>
<p>Second. In a little village upon the frontier of Austria and Bavaria there was committed
in 1893 a murder under the following circumstances. One evening, while returning by
himself along a lonely road, a rich peasant who was in the habit of carrying a considerable
sum of money with him, was killed and robbed. It was proved that his servant was the
author of the crime. This man was a natural child, very poor, and had had to work
very hard all his life. Seeing his strength going he was in great fear of being no
longer able to earn a living. His sole enjoyment in his monotonous and toilsome life
was getting drunk on Sundays. Like most of the inhabitants of his commune he was an
ardent poacher.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59775src" href="#xd31e59775">446</a>
</p>
<p>Third. In 1892 the wife of an employe of the post office was assassinated in her dwelling
in Berlin, and all her money stolen. The criminals were two young workmen of 17 and
18 years of age, one of whom knew by chance that the woman had savings.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59785src" href="#xd31e59785">447</a>
</p>
<p>These three cases, types of hundreds of others, have in common the opportunity which
had excited, in an unusual degree, the cupidity of the criminals, and the fact that
these were very poor. Whatever other causes may have entered in, it is certain that
without the great difference of fortune between the authors of the crimes and their
victims, the crimes would never have been committed.
</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the influence of the environment upon the authors of the crimes.
As we have seen, the conditions under which criminals are brought up are in general
very unfavorable, and this is especially the case with dangerous criminals. Consider,
for example, the second case (we know nothing of the environment of the criminals
in the first). What a life this murderer had behind him. The influences which give
most men their aversion to violence were entirely lacking. On the contrary his environment
had brutalized him. A natural child, he had been brought up in very poor circumstances,
and was stupefied by long and toilsome work, with a weekly intoxication as his sole
relaxation. No one would assert that this same individual would have become an assassin
if he had lived under totally different conditions.
</p>
<p>Or look at the third case. One of the guilty parties had been <span class="pageNum" id="pb596">[<a href="#pb596">596</a>]</span>brought up under unfavorable conditions (of the education of the other we know nothing),
both were forced, quite young, to earn their living and had been thrown with bad companions,
and one of them had already been sentenced to imprisonment.
</p>
<p>It is a mistake to believe that such a case is the exception instead of being the
general rule. He who takes the trouble to read the biographies of these criminals
knows that they have always been brought up in an unfavorable environment, that they
have suffered imprisonment at an early age, and have fallen lower and lower. As far
as I know there are no statistics upon this subject except those of Dr. Baer in his
study already referred to. Out of 22 young assassins examined by him 9 (40%) had had
a bad education, 11 (50%) a defective education, and only 2 (10%) a better education;
8 (36%) were orphans; 11 (50%) had been brought up in very poor circumstances and
were obliged while quite young to contribute to the support of the family; 10 (45%)
had grown up in the streets of a great city and had thus been exposed to demoralizing
influences; and 13 (60%) had received an insufficient primary education.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59803src" href="#xd31e59803">448</a>
</p>
<p>The researches of Dr. Baer have to do with Germany, but they hold good for other countries
also. Take, for example, the opinion of Tomel and Rollet, who are authors of great
experience. In speaking of the “criminal type” they say: “Well, no, this type does
not exist, since we always find the same conditions in the genesis of the criminal
temperament, and if these educational and environmental conditions had been absent,
the destiny of the little assassin might have been quite different.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59809src" href="#xd31e59809">449</a>
</p>
<p>We have still to fix our attention upon one side of the environment in which the authors
of the crimes with which we are concerned at the moment, have lived. They come generally
from an environment where,
</p>
<p>First, education often consists simply in the administration of a sound beating to
the child, a fact which habituates him to the idea that violence is an ordinary act,
especially as he sees the members of the family often strike one another;
</p>
<p>Second, the men ordinarily carry a knife, and do not hesitate to threaten with it,
or even to use it in case of a dispute. It is evident that the influence of this upon
character is great at the impressionable age of childhood. The tendency toward violence,
combated among children of the well-to-do classes, is, on the contrary, often strengthened
among the children of the poor. If later chance places <span class="pageNum" id="pb597">[<a href="#pb597">597</a>]</span>in their way an opportunity to profit by violence they recoil from it less than others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59821src" href="#xd31e59821">450</a>
</p>
<p>The authors of violent economic crimes spring nearly always from the lower classes
of the population; the exceptions are few in number. We will take up one of these
exceptions which has attained considerable notoriety, an evident proof of the rarity
of these cases.
</p>
<p>In 1878 an old woman was murdered in Paris and all her papers of value were stolen.
It was proved that Barré, a business agent, and Lebiez, a medical student, both of
whom had passed their youth in a favorable environment, were the guilty persons. This
is one of those very rare cases where objection can be made to the environment hypothesis
with a semblance of truth, but a closer examination shows that environment nevertheless
played its part in this frightful tragedy. The two criminals, sprung from fairly well-to-do
provincial families, having gone to Paris, had been living in straitened circumstances.
At the time of their deciding to commit the crime their pecuniary condition was very
bad. In the second place, both had constant recourse to prostitutes; and in the third
place both were ardent speculators. Because of his business Barré was in contact with
those who gambled at the bourse, and seeing men enrich themselves without work he
entered feverishly into speculation. He lost, drew his father into a new deal, and
was still unfortunate. In order to go on and retrieve his losses he used money entrusted
to him (his first crime), but still lost. Going from one malversation to another he
finally, in order to extricate himself, had recourse to the crime narrated above.
His accomplice was found in nearly the same situation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59834src" href="#xd31e59834">451</a>
</p>
<p>The effect of environment is to be discerned, then, as easily in this case as in those
that have been referred to before. Limiting ourselves to the principal influence alone,
we see that if these individuals had not been in contact with the world of speculation,
their cupidity would not have been excited to such a point that they were induced
to commit crime. Here the rôle played by chance in such cases clearly appears; if
they had been fortunate in their speculations they would never have become criminals.
</p>
<p>As with all crimes, the question presents itself as to how far individual factors
were active, in other words, do the individuals who are guilty of such crimes differ
from other men? Certainly, and that to a considerable extent. But in granting this
we do not, however, recognize <span class="pageNum" id="pb598">[<a href="#pb598">598</a>]</span>a <i>qualitative</i> difference between them and other men such as would make them <i>biologically abnormal</i>. The motives which have induced these persons to commit crime, are present, though
only in small measure, in everyone. Those who commit these crimes have by nature very
intense material needs; in the curve A D (see p. 534) they occupy the places near
D. As regards their social sentiments they are ranged near the other end of the curve,
and their repugnance to violence is very small. Further, they have the necessary courage
and strength.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59862src" href="#xd31e59862">452</a> If we consider how little chance there is of finding all this united in one individual,
it will become clear that few individuals are predisposed to these crimes, and when
they are committed the criminal is found in a special environment. In my opinion there
can be no question of individual factors, then; it is the environment that decides
here. There will be persons always and everywhere who run more danger than others
of committing such a crime; but it is the environment which will decide whether they
will commit it or not.
</p>
<p><i>Professional criminals.</i> The great majority of violent economic crimes are committed by professional criminals.
When an individual has fallen, from whatever reason, into the world of professional
crime, sooner or later comes the time when he must use violence if he wishes to attain
his end. Joly has very well said in his social study, “Le crime”: “The man who has
formed the habit of breaking into houses and bursting open safes, is forcibly drawn
sooner or later to rid himself of witnesses who surprise him at this work, or of a
victim who might perhaps recognize him.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59877src" href="#xd31e59877">453</a> It cannot be asserted of these individuals any more than of others, that they are
born with a special tendency toward assassination, a tendency to be explained by atavism,
or something approaching it. They have been living in an environment in which such
acts are considered as a necessary evil inherent in their trade. Driven by the tendency
to imitate, they do as others do. Certainly there are those of them who do not commit
these crimes, but that proves nothing, for it may be that chance has favored them
and they have never been under the necessity of using violence, or they have less
courage and force than the average man, or, it may be, have an exceptional innate
aversion to violence.
</p>
<p>As Professor Manouvrier remarks, the case would be entirely different if such criminals
killed without plausible motives, if they committed murder without anything but the
act in view. The facts <span class="pageNum" id="pb599">[<a href="#pb599">599</a>]</span>show that this is not so. Note the opinion of Flynt. “The taking of life is … [a]
deed that he [the professional criminal] regrets more than he has been given credit
for. One thinks of the criminal as the man who has no respect for life, as one who
takes it without any twitchings of conscience; but this is not the general rule. The
business criminal never takes a life, if he can help it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59884src" href="#xd31e59884">454</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We need not treat here of the causes which have led to the designating of these acts
as crimes; they are the same as those given above in connection with economic crimes
without violence. The harm done by these crimes is naturally greater than in the case
of crimes without violence, since they put life as well as property in danger. It
is interesting to note here, once more, the dualism of ethics; many primitive peoples
consider these acts as crimes when they are committed within the same group, but very
honorable when once the act passes beyond the limits of the group.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59902src" href="#xd31e59902">455</a> Further, with modern peoples this difference still persists; colonial wars often
resemble a colossal robbery.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We reach now the last group of economic crimes, those which are committed wholly,
or in great part, by the bourgeoisie. The motives of these crimes are not all the
same; here too it is necessary to make distinctions. The categories into which we
must distribute the motives leading to these crimes are analogous to those which lead
to theft etc., poverty and cupidity. And as in the case of theft it is necessary to
add a third category, that of the great criminals, who can be compared with criminals
by profession.
</p>
<p>The first category may be compared with that of theft committed from poverty; those
who fall into this class are persons who, for one reason or another, have seen their
business decline, and not knowing any other way to escape from their difficulties,
hope to retrieve their losses and save themselves by committing a misdeed. I take
from Moreau’s “<span lang="fr">Le Monde des Prisons</span>” a typical case. After having described how a certain R. had succeeded in setting
himself up in business and had been successful, the author speaks as follows. <span class="pageNum" id="pb600">[<a href="#pb600">600</a>]</span>“Unhappily the panic caught him among the first. His business became worse and worse.
In a few months he lost several thousand francs. Two of his traveling salesmen ran
off with their goods. Orders ceased coming in. It was failure, dishonor. He fought,
but was wrecked.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59932src" href="#xd31e59932">456</a> Finally, in order to escape ruin he committed a breach of trust; he was discovered
and convicted.
</p>
<p>We cannot say that it is absolute poverty that drives these persons to commit a crime,
for generally they have enough left to keep them from dying of hunger. And if not,
they are generally members of families who are in a position to keep them from the
worst poverty. Further they can try to provide for their wants by paid labor. Nevertheless
these cases are somewhat analogous to those of absolute poverty. Picture to yourself
the state of mind of one who has led a more or less comfortable life, who has been
independent, and enjoyed the esteem granted to a man who is well-to-do, and who sees
that the time is approaching when all this will come to an end, and that there remains
nothing for him to do but accept some minor poorly paid employment, and lead henceforth
an existence that cannot satisfy him in any way. Imagine also that chance throws in
his way an opportunity to commit a crime with good hope of success. It must be granted
that we find here very powerful determinants to crime.
</p>
<p>This cause of crimes of this class is of an entirely social nature. Under another
mode of production, for example, under that of village communities, the idea of committing
such crimes could not arise. For this reason we cannot say that social causes have
often nothing to do with the matter, but that it is the man’s own fault if his business
goes to pieces. This is certainly true at times; but it is the present organization
of society which makes it possible for a man to be in charge of an enterprise which
he is not fitted to conduct, while another who is fitted for it cannot find employment
for his talents. It is only in a society where complete anarchy reigns in the economic
life, that it is possible for a man to think he is capable of directing a business
merely because he happens to have capital.
</p>
<p>Let us now examine the other side of the question. What are the forces capable of
preventing these projects from being realized? First let us ask, what is the environment
in which many of these individuals who are guilty of such crimes are brought up? Certainly
they have learned that one must be honest, that it is wrong to pick pockets, etc.,
and they will not fail in this regard. But they have learned also that the principal
end in life is to grow rich, to succeed. <span class="pageNum" id="pb601">[<a href="#pb601">601</a>]</span>Too often this is contrary to the principle of probity. “Be honest, be honest, if
possible, but … make money!” This is the principal rule imprinted upon the minds of
the children in certain bourgeois environments. It is an honesty of a special kind
that is inculcated, not a moral honesty, but an honesty for the sake of one’s own
interests. “Honesty is the best policy” says the quasi-moral precept. Those whose
probity has this for a basis have only a weak check to prevent them from becoming
criminal, when the thought of the wrong act arises within them. They remain honest
so long as it is to their advantage, but woe to society when this is no longer the
case.
</p>
<p>But further, the environment in which these persons have lived after their youth has
not contributed to reinforce the social sentiments, and consequently those that are
working in an anti-criminal direction. “Every man for himself” is the principle of
success in such an environment. It is evident that the social sentiments must be strongly
opposed in their development if the maxim just given is that which dominates. To act
morally implies sacrificing one’s own advantage for the sake of the general good.
He who is compelled always to have his own interests at heart can give very little
thought to the interests of others.
</p>
<p>As in the case of all crimes, it is necessary with regard to these also to put the
question, are the individuals who are guilty of them, as regards their innate qualities,
like those who have lived and still live under the same conditions? And as is the
case with all crimes, the answer here must be in the negative. Those who are guilty
of these crimes are, in general, those who are below the average in the strength of
their moral qualities. They are rather weak than bad; they are conscious of the harm
that they do to others and are ashamed of it, but they are too weak to resist the
pressure of circumstances. As always it is the environment that is the cause of the
crimes’ taking place; it is the individual differences which explain in part <i>who</i> is the one to commit them. Adapting the well-known sentence of Quetelet we may say,
“it is society that prepares the crimes, it is the men of inferior moral caliber who
execute them.” If the environment were entirely different the men of inferior moral
caliber would not be guilty of crime.
</p>
<p>It may be observed, perhaps, that if it is true that a special predisposition on the
part of the individual is unnecessary for the explanation of these crimes, they ought
to be more numerous than they are. This is true enough, but it does not refute the
opinion which has been expressed. For, first, as is the case with all the others,
these crimes <span class="pageNum" id="pb602">[<a href="#pb602">602</a>]</span>are more numerous than the criminal statistics show; second, there are reasons why
some men do not commit crime, although all circumstances lead to it, and their moral
condition does not prevent. For example, there are those who, as a consequence of
the struggle for existence, have lost all energy and all courage, and give up the
fight, even the fight with dishonest weapons; others, prudent by nature, take into
consideration the fact that, bad as their situation may be, it would be worse if the
crime were discovered, etc.
</p>
<p>Statistics prove that it is really the decline of business that is the cause of a
great number of bourgeois crimes. In the first part of this work I have given some
which show this correlation, namely:
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy, 1873–1890.
</p>
<p>For this country the statistics on this question (see p. 144) have been compiled by
Dr. Fornasari di Verce. This author has shown that with the exception of fraudulent
bankruptcy (an astonishing and inexplicable fact), commercial crimes are strongly
influenced by economic happenings.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Prussia, 1854–1878.
</p>
<p>Dr. Starke has proved that the curve of these crimes is parallel with that of economic
events<span></span> (p. 65).
</p>
<p>These statistics, to be sure, are not numerous, since the number of crimes committed
by the bourgeoisie is small, and the other economic crimes, like theft, for example,
are much more important, and hence draw the attention of statisticians more.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59963src" href="#xd31e59963">457</a>
</p>
<p>We come now to the second category; bourgeois economic crimes from cupidity (as is
always the case, the line of demarcation between this group and the preceding one
is not distinctly traced, there being many gradations between the two). They are committed,
not, as in the first category, by those whose business is declining, but by those
whose affairs are more or less flourishing. The only motive, then, is cupidity; what
they get by honest business is not enough for them, they wish to become richer. After
what has been already said about cupidity it is unnecessary to go into detail here.
It has been shown that it is only under certain special circumstances that this desire
for wealth arises, and that it is unknown under others. It will be necessary only
to point out the fact that although cupidity is a strong motive with all classes of
our present society, it is especially so among the bourgeoisie, as a consequence of
their position in the economic <span class="pageNum" id="pb603">[<a href="#pb603">603</a>]</span>life. This, then, is the first and most important cause of these crimes, a cause which
is not individual, but entirely of a social nature.
</p>
<p>In the second place, the opportunity to commit these offenses undetected is enormous
(I refer especially to the adulteration of food). In general the consumer cannot judge
whether the merchandise is pure or not, and in most cases there is no inspection by
experts, or else it is worthless, since the experts are named by the producers themselves.
</p>
<p>In the third place, we have to ask ourselves, in what way does the environment in
which these persons live exercise an influence upon their social sentiments? We have
already called attention to this point some pages above, and can be brief therefore.
This environment tends to weaken the social sentiments which might act as a check
upon very egoistic acts.
</p>
<p>Considered from the point of view of the consumer the adulteration of food products
is a grave crime, for it injures the health and may even endanger the life. But what
<i>moral</i> impropriety will be seen in it by a producer who derives great profits from the exploitation
of children, or who, by a corner in grain, causes a great increase in the price of
bread? Is there, sociologically speaking, a difference between these two groups of
acts? Certainly not; the one is as harmful as the other, nay, the last two probably
more harmful than the first.
</p>
<p>This kind of crime must be the despair of those who seek for some biological anomaly
of the criminal as the primary cause of crime, for here the anomaly forms almost the
rule. Dr. Puibaraud, in his “Malfaiteurs de profession”, rightly says: “The adulteration
of food is carried on under our eyes, at our very doors, and we are so used to it
that we say nothing. They put fuchsine in our wine, margarine in our butter, chicory
in our coffee, tallow in our chocolate, and we swallow it all in perfect good humor.
What is the use of protesting? So things are, and ‘business could not be carried on’
if they gave us really pure food. So we swallow it all without gagging or moving a
muscle. Provided we are not poisoned—too quickly—we profess ourselves satisfied.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59983src" href="#xd31e59983">458</a>
</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the adulteration of food is enormous. If anyone has any doubts
let him read the reports of the chemists upon a product whose adulteration is easy,
milk, for example. His doubts will disappear rapidly; at least half of the milk is
adulterated. It is only the adulteration of food products that constitutes a legal
offense, <span class="pageNum" id="pb604">[<a href="#pb604">604</a>]</span>but the adulteration of other articles does not differ from this when considered from
a sociological point of view, and it is unnecessary to say that there too the adulteration
is enormous.
</p>
<p>There are, to be sure, manufacturers and merchants who are not guilty of such acts;
first, because certain articles cannot be adulterated; second, because in certain
branches the oversight in the interests of the consumers is very rigorous; third,
because certain producers find it more advantageous to be honest, knowing that thereby
they will procure a large body of regular customers. These three reasons have nothing
moral in them, though there is a fourth reason which affects certain producers, namely
that they have scruples against such practices.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e59992src" href="#xd31e59992">459</a>
</p>
<p>Let us consider once more the curve of the individual differences. Those persons who
should be placed between A and B are those who, if the conditions we have named are
present, will commit without scruple misdeeds of the kind we are considering. The
great average class, between B and C are those who, in general, are not guilty of
acts prohibited by law, but who probably do things which in reality do not differ
much from these, and, in any case, are not permissible by the moral code of the consumers
(for commerce has a morality of its own). These are the persons who get rid of their
merchandise by means of all sorts of tricks and dodges, are silent about the bad qualities
of their wares and exaggerate the good ones; these are the dairymen who put water
in their milk (“for absolutely pure milk is not wholesome”, they say); the doctors
who make visits when they are no longer necessary; these are those who.… But let us
stop; we could fill pages with the practices of those whose honesty is not proof against
trial.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60012src" href="#xd31e60012">460</a>
</p>
<p>In going from B to C the moral aversion to such acts, observed in individuals, becomes
gradually greater, and the danger that they will commit such practices diminishes,
and we finally approach those who should be placed between C and D, those who are
in no way guilty of such acts.
</p>
<p>As is always the case with economic crimes, it is, then, the environment that is the
cause of these offenses, while individual differences explain in part <i>who</i> are the authors of them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb605">[<a href="#pb605">605</a>]</span></p>
<p>We come now to the last category of the criminals of this group, to the great criminals,
to those who throw themselves into gigantic enterprises while knowing beforehand that
these will certainly or probably fail, or those who make great purchases of stock,
and afterward cause a rise in price through the dissemination of false news, etc.
</p>
<p>If there is any kind of crime that is the consequence of the economic environment
exclusively, this is the one. Such crimes can arise only in a time like ours, with
its insatiable thirst for gold, with the unlimited opportunity to deceive the public,
greedy for great profits. A superficial knowledge of economic history is enough to
make it plain that the bourgeois crimes, and especially those which we are now discussing,
can be committed only under an economic system of the kind that ours is.
</p>
<p>This should make those anthropologists reflect who wish always to find the causes
of crime in the man himself and not in his surroundings. Naturally the originators
of such deeds are marked out by characteristic traits. But there is no reason to admit
that persons with such dispositions could not have been born also under a different
economic system. Yet such crimes do not appear under any other mode of production.
</p>
<p>What is the kind of persons who commit these crimes which society has prepared for?
We note first that chance must have prepared such individuals in the proper environment,
for a crime of this kind. If they were in the class of agriculturists, for example,
the idea of committing it would not have occurred to them; it is only in a special
environment that such crimes can be committed.
</p>
<p>These people are characterized, in the first place, by excessive cupidity. In this
regard they come high in the curve. Their prodigality is without limits; once they
have executed a great coup they buy splendid palaces, give costly fêtes, support several
mistresses, etc. An individual of this type, Arton, had a mistress who cost him 300,000
francs in one year; he needed a million to cover his annual expenses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60042src" href="#xd31e60042">461</a> This is why they are not content with the large incomes which they could obtain honestly;
they wish to surpass others in wealth, being ordinarily very vain.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60048src" href="#xd31e60048">462</a>
</p>
<p>We have said that such individuals would probably have succeeded in securing large
incomes honestly, for all are of a high order of intelligence. In following their
machinations we are astonished by their perspicacity and their cleverness. Plans like
theirs could never <span class="pageNum" id="pb606">[<a href="#pb606">606</a>]</span>have been conceived and still less executed by men of mediocre intelligence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60058src" href="#xd31e60058">463</a>
</p>
<p>“I believe,” says Professor Morselli in his preface to Laschi’s work which we have
quoted, “in fact, that no common intelligence is needed to cover up malversations
for a long time, to organize clever swindles, outrageous frauds and bankruptcies,
exploitations of the credulous public. It needs no more talent, perhaps it needs less,
to accomplish a great number of useful and honest things, to make a so-called discovery
or invention. We have, as I have said elsewhere, a <span class="corr" id="xd31e60067" title="Source: fetichism">fetishism</span> with regard to genius, talent, higher intelligence. The effort of mental energy which
is required by the complex planning and execution of a financial crime does not differ,
as far as cerebral dynamics are concerned, from the effort demanded by an action that
is perfectly regular from a moral point of view.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60070src" href="#xd31e60070">464</a>
</p>
<p>In the third place, this class consists of persons who, as to the intensity of their
moral sentiments, take the lowest place. What an ordinary criminal does in a small
way, they do on a gigantic scale; while the former injures a single person, or only
a few, the latter bring misfortune to great numbers. And they do it with indifference,
for the disapprobation of honest men does not touch them.
</p>
<p>As I have already shown elsewhere, brought up in no matter what environment, such
individuals would not excel in the strength of their social sentiments. But I have
added that, nevertheless, the influence of the environment of these persons is very
great. We do not know much of the circumstances under which they have passed their
youth. At least Laschi makes no mention of them in “Le crime financier”, the principal
work upon this class of misdeeds. It is more than probable that their moral education
is totally lacking, or has been only very superficial. Theresa Humbert, for example,
had already been instructed by her father in the art of swindling on a large scale.
</p>
<p>On the other hand we know the environment in which they have generally passed the
rest of their lives. They belong to the world of speculation, an environment which
has very special ideas upon economic morals. In most of the cases of this kind, facts
are brought out which show that the moral ideas in these circles differ much from
those of the rest of mankind. It is evident that those who commit these crimes go
farther than the morality of their world permits. <span class="pageNum" id="pb607">[<a href="#pb607">607</a>]</span>But it takes great moral perspicacity to distinguish in this field the demarcations
between what is permitted and what is not, and it is just this perspicacity that some
persons lack. This is why most criminals of this kind, when they are brought into
court, say with sincere conviction that they are innocent, that they have done nothing
that is incompatible with morality.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60101src" href="#xd31e60101">465</a>
</p>
<p>Then, speculation etc. is one of the infallible means for killing all social sentiments;
it is egoism pure and simple. Can we be astonished that some of these individuals<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60130src" href="#xd31e60130">466</a> in such an environment enter into conflict with the penal law? It seems to me not.
Nor is there any reason to grant that they are abnormal from a biological point of
view. So even the Italian school is forced to admit that the stigmata found elsewhere
cannot be pointed out in these individuals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60142src" href="#xd31e60142">467</a> Furthermore, in this case we can hardly speak of atavism. It may be that our ancestors
were great offenders, but it is not probable that they ever were guilty of swindles
of this kind.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to speak fully of the reasons which cause these acts to be classed
as crimes. They are harmful to the regular progress of capitalism and consequently
are threatened with penalties. The punishment of the adulteration of food-stuffs,
on the contrary, is a consequence of the opposition of the consumers to one of the
harmful effects of this system.
</p>
<p>In this connection it is interesting to note, first, that the penalties prescribed
for these crimes are relatively light as compared with those for ordinary economic
crimes, like theft, for example, especially when we reflect that the harm done by
them is much greater; second, that the number of punishable acts is very limited as
compared with those which really deserve punishment. As Baccaro observes in his work,
“<span lang="it">Genesi e funzione delle leggi penali</span>”, it is these crimes which show clearly the class character of the penal law.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60154src" href="#xd31e60154">468</a>

<h3 class="main">SEXUAL CRIMES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most authors who treat of the correlation between criminality and economic conditions,
have devoted their attention to economic crimes especially, and have had little or
nothing to say about sexual crimes. Man’s sexual instincts, they say, have nothing
to do with the economic life, they are a factor apart, and accordingly there is no
relation between criminal sexuality and economic conditions.
</p>
<p>We flatter ourselves that we shall be able to show that their opinion is erroneous,
that a relation between sexual criminality and economic conditions does exist, although
it is by nature less direct than that between economic crimes and the mode of production.
</p>
<p>Having already remarked that the social forms of the sexual life (marriage and prostitution)
are, in the last analysis, determined by the mode of production, we will not return
to this topic. And it does not fall within the province of this work to speak of the
relation of the intensity of the sexual life in general to economic conditions. From
history we see that the sexual life plays now a greater, now a smaller part. It would
be hard to admit that the causes of these changes are within man and not outside of
him, particularly when very evident causes are to be found in the environment. Who
does not see that the intensity of the sexual life of the upper classes of Rome of
the decadence is explained by the exaggerated luxury, the idle existence of this group,
and the dependent position of a part of the women (slaves).
</p>
<p>In our present society the relation between the sexual life and economic conditions
is equally clear. Everyone knows that the sexuality which occupies a very great place
in that part of the bourgeoisie which passes its life in idleness and prodigality,
is the consequence of this manner of living. On the other hand the low intellectual
condition of the proletariat is the cause of a sexual life much more intense than
it would be if the environment permitted a harmonious development of the whole nature.
Engels, in his “Condition of the Working-class in England”, says of the English proletarians,
what is applicable <span class="pageNum" id="pb609">[<a href="#pb609">609</a>]</span>to the workers in other countries also. “Next to intemperance in the enjoyment of
intoxicating liquors, one of the principal faults of English working-men is sexual
license. But this, too, follows with relentless logic, with inevitable necessity out
of the position of a class left to itself, with no means of making use of its freedom.
The bourgeoisie has left the working-class only these two pleasures, while imposing
upon it a multitude of labors and hardships, and the consequence is that the working-men,
in order to get something <span class="corr" id="xd31e60169" title="Source: our">out</span> of life, concentrate their whole energy upon these two enjoyments, carry them to
excess, surrender to them in the most unbridled manner.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60172src" href="#xd31e60172">469</a>
</p>
<p>Further the dependent economic position of woman in our present society is also a
factor of the increase of the intensity of the sexual life (especially prostitution).
</p>
<p>However, it is not this question but sexual criminality upon which we must fix our
attention. Here also we must divide the crimes into groups, as they differ too much
among themselves to be treated of together. We shall take up in order, then: A. Adultery;
B. Rape and indecent assault upon adults; C. Rape and indecent assault upon children.
</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="ch2.2.3.a">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">A.</span> <span class="sc">Adultery.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been said, “the history of property is also that of theft.” In the same way
we may say that the history of monogamy is also that of adultery, or in other words,
that there is no monogamy without adultery. There must be, therefore, powerful and
constant causes occasioning this offense. As we have seen above when we were setting
forth briefly the history of marriage, adultery by the man was a permitted act at
different stages of the social development.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60186src" href="#xd31e60186">470</a> If we ask why men committed this permitted act, but one reason can be alleged; <i>they are not monogamous by nature</i>. On the part of the woman the same act constituted, on the other hand, most often
a very serious offense, threatened with the most severe penalties, which did not,
however, prevent adultery on her side also. The cause is not different for the two
sexes; women, too, are not monogamous by nature, though perhaps more nearly so than
men.
</p>
<p>From what we have just said the etiology of this crime is fixed. The only difference
between the present and the past is that adultery <span class="pageNum" id="pb610">[<a href="#pb610">610</a>]</span>by the man also is punished in our time—there is no change in the etiology of the
crime. It may be said that the fundamental cause of adultery is to be found in the
nature of man, then, and that it is thus anthropological and not social. I cannot
admit this view of the matter any more than I can believe that the ultimate cause
of theft is the necessity of eating in order to live. If the fundamental cause of
the offense of which we are treating is to be found in man, it would be present always
and everywhere <i>without reference to the environment</i>. Sociology shows however, that this is not so. Up to a certain degree of social development
men and women alike have been free in this respect; in other cases it is only the
woman who is forced to remain true to her husband; and at times both have been compelled
to remain faithful. Consequently, for one who does not consider society as an immovable
body, but sees that everything is in motion, the fundamental cause of this crime is
to be found in the structure of society itself, which in certain cases, prohibits
a man from satisfying his natural inclinations. When the polygamous tendencies are
stronger than the pressure of society a crime is committed.
</p>
<p>If we consulted only the criminal statistics we should hardly ever meet with adultery.
It is unnecessary to add that the penal laws dealing with this matter are so drawn
up that a prosecution for adultery almost never takes place; it goes without saying,
however, that in reality the offense is very common.
</p>
<p>In the first place we must look into the question of the classes of society in which
the offense occurs oftenest. Though there are no statistics on the matter I believe
that we shall not be far wrong in saying that adultery takes place oftenest in that
part of the bourgeoisie that lives in idleness, often also among the proletariat,
and least often among the intellectual bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. In seeking
for the causes of this fact we see clearly that they cannot be found in the man himself,
for the individuals forming these classes do not differ as to their innate characteristics.
Consequently, these causes must be found in the environment; the following being the
principal ones.
</p>
<p>First. The more marriage is contracted for convenience the greater the danger of adultery.
This is one reason why adultery is more common among the “upper ten thousand”, where
marriage is often a commercial affair, and why it is less frequent among the intellectual
bourgeoisie, in which there are more marriages of inclination.
</p>
<p>Second. The more frivolous and trifling the life any class leads, the more frequent
will adultery be in it. This is another reason why <span class="pageNum" id="pb611">[<a href="#pb611">611</a>]</span>adultery is frequent among the idle rich, and less frequent in the intellectual class
and the petty bourgeoisie.
</p>
<p>Third. The more the social causes of marriage are felt in a certain class, the greater
the moral aversion to adultery. This is one reason why this offense is found less
often among the petty bourgeoisie than in the working class.
</p>
<p>Fourth. The greater the number of marriages concluded for purely physical reasons
without any intellectual reasons entering in, the more numerous will be the cases
of adultery. This applies especially to the proletariat, among whom most of the marriages
are contracted from affection, but where, because of lack of culture, there is often
no possibility of intellectual communion. When this harmony is lacking it comes about
that the difficulties of life, so great in this class, cause an estrangement from
which infidelities frequently result.
</p>
<p>Finally, let us consider briefly the question of which individuals in the different
classes are guilty of adultery. The predisposition to polygamy is not the same for
all. In the second place, the sexual instincts are much more intense in some cases
than in others. In the third place the environment in which one has lived is not the
same as that of another, and opportunities do not occur in the same way for each.
The joint action of these causes explains sufficiently why one commits the offense
in question and not another.
</p>
<p>In setting forth the etiology of adultery we have been giving the reasons why it has
been designated as a crime. Little by little the conception of marriage has been modified
in consequence of the social changes that have taken place; there is a growing number
of persons who consider the life in common permissible only when both parties desire
it without being constrained by the law. The partisans of this opinion disapprove
of adultery, but for different reasons from others, who consider it as the infraction
of an acquired right. Professor Ferri formulates this new morality as follows. “What
is vile about adultery is not that it is an assault upon individual property, it is
the disloyalty of the act, the trickery and hypocrisy of it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60239src" href="#xd31e60239">471</a>
</p>
<p>While finding adultery immoral the adherents of this opinion believe that the law
has no right to interfere. Even the persons who do not share their point of view believe
that the penal code should cease to concern itself with this crime. Hence it comes,
among other things, that the laws are so drawn that prosecutions are very rare. It
is probable that adultery will disappear from the list of offenses.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his work, “<span lang="fr">Genèse normale du crime</span>”, Professor Manouvrier expresses himself as follows upon the crime of rape. “Every
normally constituted man would be a born violator if the sexual appetite could find
no other means of satisfaction than rape. The crime is rare, however, and we know
why; there are women for the ugliest and the poorest. However, famine may come; there
is also opportunity, and many devils capable of leading into temptation the brute
that every man is at his birth. For the ‘criminologists’ must not delude themselves
upon this point if they wish to make criminal anthropology truly scientific. If we
were to take a well-born child of a distinguished European family, and isolate him
from his birth from all the influences of environment except those strictly necessary
for the preservation of his life, we do not know what strange beast he would turn
into. On the other hand we do know that behind our acquired polish our natural brutality
still persists.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60271src" href="#xd31e60271">472</a> Here in a few words is the environment theory applied to the origin of the most serious
sexual crimes. Let us consult some facts to see whether the theory is correct.
</p>
<p>First of all it must be remarked that this crime is not the act of a pervert but of
a brute. It is important not to forget this since perversion does play a part in the
crimes which we shall take up under C. Some authors do not make a distinction between
these two kinds of crimes, which prevents their giving a really fundamental treatment
of the etiology of them.
</p>
<p>Let us see what the movement of this crime teaches. Its curve in the different months
shows that it rises towards spring, to reach its maximum in summer, after which it
regularly decreases, reaching its minimum in winter. An example of this is given in
the following table, which includes also crimes committed against children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60277src" href="#xd31e60277">473</a>

<p>The movement of sexual crimes does not tell us much about their etiology. It is plain
that the opportunity of committing them occurs much oftener in summer than in winter,
and the chance of catching the criminal “<span lang="la">in flagrante delicto</span>” is also much greater during the hot months. Even without statistics we should know
that the temptation to these acts is greater in warm weather, and further, the rise
of temperature towards spring probably increases the sexual tendencies. But all this
does not explain the origin of this class of crimes, for if it is true that the sexual
tendencies in man are increased by the rise of the temperature toward spring, this
affects the sexual life <i>in general</i>, and not the <i>sexual criminality</i> alone (as is shown by the column of the days of conception).
</p>
<p>In the same way we learn little of the etiology of these crimes from their movement
in the course of the years. In the first part of this work we have given some statistics
on this question, which we recapitulate here with additional data.
</p>
<p class="subheading">England.
</p>
<p>The author of the English criminal statistics of 1899 fixes attention upon the fact
that the maximum of sexual crimes was reached in 1893 and 1894, when the price of
wheat was very low<span></span> (p. 48).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb614">[<a href="#pb614">614</a>]</span></p>
<p class="subheading">France, 1825–1878.
</p>
<p>As Professor Ferri shows in his study upon the influence of temperature,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60550src" href="#xd31e60550">474</a> the curve of rape committed upon adults presents some resemblance to that of economic
events, the years that were economically bad coinciding with the minimum figures for
the crime in question. Thus the unfavorable years of 1835–37, 1846–47, 1865–68 brought
a diminution of rapes committed upon adults, and the favorable years of 1832–35, 1847–50,
1857–59 an increase. Although there are some exceptions, the influence of the economic
situation is indubitable.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy, 1873–1890.
</p>
<p>Dr. Fornasari di Verce says that indecent assaults increase with the improvement in
economic conditions, and vice versa (p. 143). On the other hand, Dr. Colajanni proved
for the different parts of Italy (1875–1880) that a greater consumption of meat did
<i>not</i> lead in most cases (22 out of 35) to an increase in the number of indecent assaults
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 501–504).
</p>
<p class="subheading">New South Wales, 1882–1891.
</p>
<p>As we have seen in Part One (p. 144) Dr. Fornasari di Verce has shown that in this
country sexual crimes increase in prosperous years, and vice versa.
</p>
<p class="subheading">Prussia, 1854–1896.
</p>
<p>As to this country, Professor von Oettingen gives, for the years 1854–1859 and 1862–1871,
some figures which show a slight connection between the price of grain and sexual
crimes (Part One, pp. 53, 54). Dr. Müller also shows (see the tables pp. 77, 78 and
pp. 80, 81) that economic conditions exercise an influence upon sexual crimes; thus,
for example, the years 1857–1859 were characterized by cheap grain and high figures
for sexual crimes; the same was true of the years 1863–1866 and 1869. On the contrary
the years 1854–1856 and 1861, show a high price for grain and low figures for the
crimes in question. There were, however, some exceptions; during the crisis of 1873–74
the sexual crimes did not decrease, and in the following years the correspondence
of the curve of these crimes with that of the economic situation is no longer to be
noted.
</p>
<p>The data upon the relation between the economic situation and <span class="pageNum" id="pb615">[<a href="#pb615">615</a>]</span>these crimes are not as numerous as those upon economic crimes, and there are also
many exceptions. With some reservations, however, we can say that an improvement in
economic conditions tends to increase the crimes in question. However, this does not
teach us much with regard to the etiology of them; the statistics of births have long
since shown us that the sexual life is more intense during the periods of economic
prosperity, than during those of depression.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60580src" href="#xd31e60580">475</a> Better nourishment renders the sexual instincts stronger, without its being necessary
that they should manifest themselves in a criminal manner. The proof of this is furnished
by those who are sufficiently nourished both in good times and bad and are yet not
guilty of these crimes. (For statistical proofs see the statistics given later.)
</p>
<p>We must then try to discover the true crime-producing factors in other statistical
data. First let us inquire whether married or unmarried persons are more often guilty?
As we have seen above, German criminal statistics are the only ones which give us
absolutely certain information on this point. These show (see p. 454) that at all
ages bachelors, widowers, and divorced men are more often guilty of sexual crimes
than married men, and at certain ages much more so. Unfortunately these statistics
do not distinguish the rapes committed upon adults from those committed upon children.
The data of Dr. J. Socquet give us some slight information.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60595src" href="#xd31e60595">476</a>

</p>
<p>Marriage, then, tends to diminish the number of these crimes. The economic life having,
in its turn an influence upon the number of marriages the relation between this life
and the crimes in question is clear. If the economic situation of many persons did
not prevent their contracting marriage at the period of life indicated by nature,
these <span class="pageNum" id="pb616">[<a href="#pb616">616</a>]</span>crimes would be much less frequent. As Dr. Augagneur says: “Our laws and physiological
exigencies do not harmonize.”
</p>
<p>A second question is, what is the class of the population that commits these crimes?
As we have seen, the statistics of Italy and Austria show (see pp. 437, 438) that
it is almost exclusively the poor who are guilty of sexual crimes. In Italy 92.1%
are indigent or have only the strict necessaries of life; in Austria 91.2% are without
fortune, and only 0.2% are well-to-do.
</p>
<p>The statistics of the professions of convicts in Germany (see p. 441) show also that
those who are arraigned for these crimes are especially working-men, and particularly
unskilled laborers (among whom the statistics include also white-slave traders, professional
criminals, etc., see p. 442). Unfortunately these statistics do not distinguish between
sexual crimes committed upon adults and those committed upon children. The following
table shows that the number is greater for the first than for the second of these
crimes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60653src" href="#xd31e60653">477</a>

<p>Although this table by itself has little value, since the comparative figures for

<p>Even when we take account of the fact that the rural population in France is more
numerous than the urban, we still see that the crime in question is committed in the
country especially.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60875src" href="#xd31e60875">479</a>
</p>
<p>We must further inquire what is the part of the proletariat that is guilty of rape
upon adults? The answer must be that it is that which forms the lowest stratum of
society. As preceding statistics have shown us (see pp. 427–430, 432), the number
of illiterates or of those who know only how to read and write, is very great among
the authors of sexual crimes. The following table gives us data more detailed and
concerned only with rape upon adults.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60889src" href="#xd31e60889">480</a>

<p>Upon the basis of this table we have the right to say, then, that this crime is almost
never committed by persons having more than a primary education.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb618">[<a href="#pb618">618</a>]</span></p>
<p>This fact destroys the theory that the “human beast” exists independent of environment;
for if such were the case, this crime would be relatively as frequent among more highly
developed persons as among those that are less so. This table proves what is always
forgotten by criminal anthropologists, that a man becomes a brute only under certain
fixed circumstances, and commits then acts that would be repugnant to him if he lived
in a different environment.
</p>
<p>Those who commit these acts come from the strata of society in which, in consequence
of their living conditions, the sexual life is considered from a purely animal point
of view. What is the environment in which the children of the lowest classes grow
up, and what is the sexual morality that they derive from it? The simple truth is
that there is no sexual morality for them. In consequence of the detestable housing
conditions (compare what was said upon this subject in connection with prostitution)
and of the bad society with which they are thrown, the children are thoroughly conversant
with the sexual life in its most bestial manifestations. Their attention is fixed
upon the sexual life at an age at which it is still a closed book to children brought
up in a wholesome environment. As Dr. Lux says in his excellent study upon sexual
crimes, “Need, misery, and vice are the natural surroundings of the children of the
proletariat, and especially of the lower proletariat; they form the environment out
of which the child draws his first and most lasting impressions; they are the school
from which they derive the lessons of a system of ethics which is in marked contrast
with the ethics of progressive humanity. Conceptions of moral restraints can hardly
be awakened in the offspring of the lowest ranks of the proletariat; on the contrary,
so far as the sexual sphere is concerned, they are suppressed by the undisguised sexual
intercourse of parents, other adults, and prostitutes, with whom the children are
continually coming into contact.…”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e60965src" href="#xd31e60965">481</a>
</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the lower position of woman in our present society is that
man considers women as destined to submit to his sexual will. This is especially the
case in the lower strata of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb619">[<a href="#pb619">619</a>]</span>population, where the woman is often only a means by which the man may satisfy his
desires.
</p>
<p>Finally, alcoholism is still to be added as a <span class="corr" id="xd31e61035" title="Source: crimogenic">criminogenous</span> factor. Above (pp. 509 <i>ff.</i>) we have seen that there are many chronic alcoholics among the authors of these crimes;
in Germany 23.3% and 20.5%, in France 51.5% and 55.7%, in the Netherlands 10.84%,
and in Wurtemberg 36.3%.
</p>
<p>There is still another way in which alcoholism figures in the etiology of these crimes.
At a certain stage of intoxication the sexual instincts are stimulated, while the
moral forces are weakened.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61042src" href="#xd31e61042">482</a> So in the cases where a sexual crime has been committed in a state of drunkenness
we may be sure that alcohol has been one of the principal factors of it. The following
figures give us some information on this point.
</p>
<p class="subheading">England.
</p>
<p>In his report to the international penitentiary congress at Brussels, Dr. M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;C.
Sullivan shows, as the result of an investigation, that more than 50% of the sexual
crimes were caused by alcoholism, and that acute alcoholism is especially active in
the case of rape upon adults.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61054src" href="#xd31e61054">483</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Austria, 1896–1897.
</p>
<p>Out of 179 cases of rape, etc., there were 46 (25.7%) committed in a state of drunkenness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61065src" href="#xd31e61065">484</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">France.
</p>
<p>In his report at the Congress mentioned above, Marambat says that 6.6% of the rapes
and indecent assaults have been committed in a state of intoxication.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61079src" href="#xd31e61079">485</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Netherlands.
</p>
<p>The criminal statistics show that 11.82% of those convicted of sexual crimes commit
them under the influence of alcoholic drinks.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61090src" href="#xd31e61090">486</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Sweden.
</p>
<p>Sigfrid Wieselgren, director general of the penitentiary establishments of Sweden,
in his report to the Brussels Congress gives a table <span class="pageNum" id="pb620">[<a href="#pb620">620</a>]</span>which shows that about 36% of those guilty of indecent assault were drunk at the time
of the crime.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61102src" href="#xd31e61102">487</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Switzerland, 1892–1896.
</p>
<p>According to the criminal statistics, 21.5% of all the sexual crimes are due to alcoholism.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61131src" href="#xd31e61131">488</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>To sum up, we see that the causes of these crimes are the economic condition which
prevents some individuals from marrying at the natural age, the inferior social position
of woman, alcoholism, and above all the sexual demoralization and lack of civilization
in the lowest strata of society.
</p>
<p>It is plain that not all the individuals who live in this environment are guilty of
the crimes in question. The sexual instincts do not have equal force at all ages,
nor with all individuals. There are individuals who have very pronounced sexual propensities,
others who are almost indifferent in this respect, and between the two extremes lies
the great majority. It is only for the first class that the danger of a crime against
morals is great, for the others it is less so. If the opportunity (rape is almost
always an “occasional” crime) presents itself to persons already predisposed, the
moral check to restrain them is lacking. If they had lived in another environment,
this act would be repugnant to them, as statistics prove; for this crime is not committed
by persons of the other classes, although there are naturally proportionally more
persons with strong sexual instincts among them. The opportunity to commit these crimes
is happily not very frequent. As Voltaire has expressed it, “Rape is a crime as hard
to prove as it is to commit.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We must add a few words upon the history of this crime and the causes that have led
to its being classified as such. As Dr. Post (the principal authority upon this question)
has shown, among many primitive peoples rape is only considered as a detriment to
the property of the man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61147src" href="#xd31e61147">489</a> It is only little by little as the position of woman <span class="pageNum" id="pb621">[<a href="#pb621">621</a>]</span>improves, and her individuality is recognized, that rape is considered as a grave
encroachment upon the liberty of the woman, and that it is punished as such.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An examination of the etiology of these crimes shows that in great part the individuals
who are guilty of them belong to the same category of criminals as those who commit
sexual crimes upon adults. If they seduce or outrage a child and not a woman it is
from accidental reasons (opportunity, lack of bodily strength, etc.); they are brutes
who wish to satisfy their sexual instincts at any price; they are not, however, perverts.
Although there is a quantitative difference between the man who violates an adult
and one who commits this act upon a child (the latter being grosser and more egoistic
than the former), there is no qualitative difference between the two so far as the
majority of the criminals of whom we are speaking are concerned. We should only repeat
ourselves if we treated of the etiology of these crimes more fully.
</p>
<p>As with the crimes of which we were speaking above, there is with crimes against children
also, a great increase toward spring, the maximum being reached in the month of June,
after which there is a decrease, with the minimum in winter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61171src" href="#xd31e61171">490</a> The statistics given for France show also that in this country the periods of economic
prosperity bring an increase of these crimes, and the periods of depression a decrease.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61184src" href="#xd31e61184">491</a> And it is probably the same with other countries. As has been said also of the crimes
against adults, all this shows us very little of the etiology of these crimes, since
the intensity of the sexual life in general rises and falls in accordance with the
economic situation.
</p>
<p>Here also the married men play a smaller part than the unmarried and divorced; the
poor classes show a larger number of crimes than those that have property (see p.
616); the illiterate, and persons who know how to read and write simply, show also
proportionately higher figures than persons with a higher education,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61197src" href="#xd31e61197">492</a> and alcoholism again takes its place among the causes of this crime.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61216src" href="#xd31e61216">493</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb622">[<a href="#pb622">622</a>]</span></p>
<p>A minute comparison of the statistics of sexual crimes committed upon adults and of
those upon children shows that a part of the latter are of a character quite different
from the former. By comparing, for example, the statistics of the civil status of
persons arraigned, we see that the number of married men and widowers is proportionately
much greater in the case of crimes against children than against adults. The following
table shows this:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61239src" href="#xd31e61239">494</a>

<p>A comparison of the statistics of the occupation of the two groups of these criminals
(see p. 616) shows that in the crimes upon children, the liberal professions show
twice as many as those committed upon adults. The same is true of merchants.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61284src" href="#xd31e61284">495</a>
</p>
<p>The figures with regard to education show that the illiterate are about equally numerous

</p>
<p>While, as we have seen, sexual crimes upon adults are chiefly committed in the country,

<p>Contrary to what we find with regard to sexual crimes against adults it is also the
departments with the great cities which, in comparison with the rural districts, give
the highest figures.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61359src" href="#xd31e61359">498</a>
</p>
<p>It appears from an examination of these data that sexual crimes upon children and
those upon adults have, in part a different etiology. Many sexual crimes upon children
are committed by persons who could also satisfy their desires with adults, but abuse
children instead. These, then, are cases of sexual perverts.
</p>
<p>A thorough examination of the causes of this perversion would be ill placed in the
midst of our investigation of the social etiology of crime, for they are principally
of a pathological nature. However prostitution should be mentioned as contributing
more to sexual demoralization than any other cause. As Dr. Després says in his work
“La prostitution en France”, “Physicians think that rape<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61381src" href="#xd31e61381">499</a> is an aberration of the genetic faculty and that this crime is more often the result
of satiety than of deprivation of the natural exercise of the genital functions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61384src" href="#xd31e61384">500</a>
</p>
<p>Dr. Ladame expresses himself thus. “All the causes which divert the genetic faculty
from its natural end may lead to crime, and among these causes prostitution plays,
without doubt, the principal part.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61390src" href="#xd31e61390">501</a>
</p>
<p>It is plainly difficult to show by figures the degree of importance of <span class="pageNum" id="pb624">[<a href="#pb624">624</a>]</span>prostitution in the etiology of sexual crimes. The Swiss statistics, which try, though
very imperfectly, to record the causes of crimes, say that 5.3% of the sexual crimes
are caused by prostitution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61406src" href="#xd31e61406">502</a> It is unnecessary to say that this figure is too low.
</p>
<p>We may add in conclusion that it is almost always upon the children of the poor that
these crimes are committed. The children of well-to-do parents are so well guarded
that crimes against them are the rare exceptions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61412src" href="#xd31e61412">503</a>

<p class="first">Besides economic, sexual, and political criminality, there is still a fourth category
of crimes, the motives of which are quite diverse. We shall treat, A. Crimes from
vengeance, and B. Infanticide. The first group is important both quantitatively and
qualitatively; the second, especially, qualitatively. The crimes committed from other
motives are either very rare, or very insignificant, or may be explained by the same
causes as those included under A, and hence may be passed over in silence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61494src" href="#xd31e61494">504</a>

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">A.</span> <span class="sc">Crimes Committed from Vengeance.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a sociological work like ours we need not consider the psychology of vengeance.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61552src" href="#xd31e61552">505</a> For our subject it is sufficient to show that the feeling is innate in everyone,
although in different degrees. As soon as one person injures another, whether bodily,
or in his interests, or his honor, the desire to retaliate in one way or another immediately
appears. If this desire transforms itself into act, this act calls forth a stronger
reaction on the part of the opposing party, etc. It is this that is called the instinct
of vengeance.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61561src" href="#xd31e61561">506</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb626">[<a href="#pb626">626</a>]</span></p>
<p>We must then begin by treating the causes calling forth feelings of revenge, and by
fixing our attention upon the two principal categories of causes, those which spring
from the economic life, and those which are due to the sexual life.
</p>
<p>We shall speak first of the causes that are due to the economic life. The fundamental
principle of the mode of production in which we live is competition, strife—in other
words, doing injury to others. So there are innumerable cases in which the desire
for revenge is excited by the economic life. Many sociologists extol the beauty of
this struggle and pretend that its effect upon society is excellent. We shall refrain
from examining the truth or falsity of this statement; for the matter in hand we need
not concern ourselves with the fortunate victors, but simply with the vanquished.
After the exposition of the present system of production it is superfluous to show
all the opposing economic interests and the feelings resulting therefrom; we shall
mention a few, and the others will be easily understood.
</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, the state of mind of a small retailer who finds himself totally
ruined by the competition of a large department store in the neighborhood; of that
of <span class="corr" id="xd31e61599" title="Source: workingmen">working-men</span> suffering great privations during a strike, who see themselves supplanted by others,
who think only of their immediate interest in acting as strike-breakers. Or imagine,
again, the innumerable cases in which questions of inheritance awaken vengeful feelings.
And side by side with all this, picture the economic life of village-communities where
all the economic interests were parallel, and where consequently the economic life
engendered neither envy nor jealousy. Anyone who grasps the enormous difference between
these two modes of production, will understand also how the feelings of revenge are
excited by the present economic system.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61602src" href="#xd31e61602">507</a>
</p>
<p>In the second place, how far are vengeful feelings aroused by sexuality?<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61633src" href="#xd31e61633">508</a> As Sutherland remarks in his “Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct”, there are
no peoples who are not more or less jealous in sexual matters,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61646src" href="#xd31e61646">509</a> but great differences are to be observed in this respect. While Nansen, for example
tells how the Eskimo women are almost ignorant of sexual jealousy,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61649src" href="#xd31e61649">510</a> there are other peoples among <span class="pageNum" id="pb627">[<a href="#pb627">627</a>]</span>whom the woman is killed by her husband if another man evinces any regard for her.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61654src" href="#xd31e61654">511</a>
</p>
<p>The facts show that the greater the power of the man over the woman, the greater also
is the sexual jealousy of the man, a jealousy which, among other things, manifests
itself in the very severe punishment of adultery.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61664src" href="#xd31e61664">512</a> He who has a right to something wishes to keep it for himself and does not tolerate
injury to it on the part of anyone else. When the man considers the woman as his chattel,
or when he has great power over her, sexual jealousy is strengthened by the feelings
connected with property. These latter feelings were more predominant among the primitive
peoples than true sexual jealousy, a proof of which is that fact that among many of
these peoples the law of hospitality required putting the wife at the disposal of
the guest.
</p>
<p>From the present form of marriage (as among many primitive peoples) it follows that
each party has a right with relation to the other.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61679src" href="#xd31e61679">513</a> The violation of this right is considered as a serious injury and gives rise to a
desire for revenge. This phenomenon is not natural, but historical. If the present
state of society did not necessitate an artificial stability in sexual relationships,
if the man and his wife were economically independent, they would not believe that
they had rights over each other.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61682src" href="#xd31e61682">514</a>
</p>
<p>Here is the first bond between sexual jealousy and the social environment, but there
is also a second, though a more remote one, namely, that it is with those who have
a gross conception of the relations of man and wife, that revengeful feelings arise
after love disappears. Those who, because of the environment in which they live, have
formed a different idea of the relation between man and wife, while feeling the most
violent grief, remain strangers to the desire for revenge. He who knows that neither
love nor sympathy can be bidden, knows also that a right in this matter can bring
no change in the feelings, and must remain only a nominal thing; he sees only the
action of fate, where the brute sees an evil will. This is one reason why the number
of crimes of passion is smaller among civilized people than among the partly civilized.
</p>
<p>We must notice, further, one kind of crime of passion, the revenge of a woman seduced
and then abandoned. Besides sexual jealousy <span class="pageNum" id="pb628">[<a href="#pb628">628</a>]</span>there are, in these cases, other motives playing their part. Often the woman has not
given herself for love alone, but also with the prospect of a marriage, or a betterment
of her economic position. It is not sexual vengeance that is the sole motive here
then, but also vengeance for economic reasons.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61694src" href="#xd31e61694">515</a> Further the prohibition of inquiring into the question of paternity may also enter
in.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61702src" href="#xd31e61702">516</a>
</p>
<p>After having pointed out the two principal categories of causes that awaken revengeful
feelings we must now enquire why, with certain individuals, these feelings are translated
into acts. Many criminologists prefer to find environment of small importance in these
crimes and the individual factors the predominant ones. Let us see whether the facts
will uphold this theory. To begin with let us ask what the movement of these crimes
teaches us.

<p>Some authors seek for a remote explanation, when there is one near at hand: in summer
persons are more in contact with each other, a fact which gives opportunity for disputes,
and an increased danger of consequent crimes.
</p>
<p>We may sum up the principal data upon the movement of these crimes in relation to
the economic situation (given in Part One of this work) as follows.
</p>
<p class="subheading">England, 1840–1890.
</p>
<p>Fornasari di Verce draws attention to the fact that crimes against persons (represented
in great part by crimes of <span class="corr" id="xd31e61832" title="Source: vengenace">vengeance</span>) increase <span class="pageNum" id="pb629">[<a href="#pb629">629</a>]</span>in times of economic prosperity and vice versa (see p. 144. See also the data of Mayr,
pp. 43 and 44).
</p>
<p class="subheading">Bavaria, 1835–1861.
</p>
<p>Mayr shows for this period that crimes against persons increase when the price of
grain falls and vice versa (see pp. 40–42).
</p>
<p class="subheading">Italy, 1873–1890.
</p>
<p>According to Fornasari di Verce there is a diminution of homicides and assaults when
economic conditions grow worse, and vice versa (see p. 143).
</p>
<p class="subheading">New South Wales, 1882–1891.
</p>
<p>The same author says that homicides and assaults increase, while minor offenses against
persons decrease, when economic conditions grow worse and vice versa (see p. 144).
</p>
<p class="subheading">Prussia, 1854–1896.
</p>
<p>Dr. Starke and Dr. Müller show that the crimes we are considering increase when economic
conditions improve, and decrease when they grow worse (see pp. 66 and 83). However,
they show at the same time that these phenomena did not take place at the beginning
of the period observed by them. Later they follow the regular course.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61851src" href="#xd31e61851">518</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Canton of <span class="corr" id="xd31e61877" title="Source: Zurich">Zürich</span>, 1853–1892.
</p>
<p>For the period mentioned Meyer proves that crimes against persons increase when economic
conditions improve (see p. 69).
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Examining these results we observe that the crimes in question increase in the <span class="corr" id="xd31e61886" title="Source: priods">periods</span> of prosperity, and vice versa; but we see at the same time that there are also noteworthy
exceptions (New South Wales and France), and that in Germany in the last 20 or 30
years, this tendency is no longer present.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61889src" href="#xd31e61889">519</a> It is not difficult, it seems to me, <span class="pageNum" id="pb630">[<a href="#pb630">630</a>]</span>to explain why these crimes increase in periods of prosperity. Men are thrown then
into contact more frequently, they live a little more for amusement, and consume (and
this is certainly one of the principal reasons) more alcohol than usual. Some authors
see in this movement of crimes against persons a natural law, according to which criminality
would be a fixed quantity, manifesting itself in economic crimes in periods of depression,
and in crimes against the person in periods of prosperity.
</p>
<p>As I have already said more than once this theory is erroneous. If it were really
true that an improvement of the economic situation <i>inevitably</i> brought about an increase of crimes against persons, the class of individuals who
are always in fairly good circumstances would also be largely guilty of these crimes.
Statistics show us the contrary.
</p>
<p>Thus we arrive at the very important question, what are the classes of the population
which are especially guilty of these crimes? As the statistics already given show
they are the poorest classes (see pp. 437 <i>ff.</i>). In Italy, for example, 89.8% of those who commit homicide, and 91.1% of those guilty
of assault, were indigent or had only the bare necessities of life, though these form
but 60% of the population. The same is true of Austria, and the statistics of occupations
gives a similar result for Germany (see pp. 441 and 442).
</p>
<p>The statistics that give information upon the degree of education of these criminals
are more interesting still. As we have seen above, only 0.1% of those guilty of assault
had a higher education, while 40.5% of these criminals were illiterate, and 59.4%
knew only how to read, or to read and write. In France from 1896 to 1900 the completely
illiterate constituted 16% of those guilty of assault, and 15% of the assassins, while
in the general population <span class="corr" id="xd31e61907" title="Source: these">there</span> were only 4.5% who did not know how to sign their names. In Italy only 1% of the
assassins and only 0.6% of those guilty of assault had a higher education, 99% and
99.4% respectively were illiterate or knew only how to read and write. These are striking
figures.
</p>
<p>In this connection let us stop for a moment to consider the geography of these crimes,
and place beside the figures on this point those of illiteracy. We will begin with
a table of figures for homicide and assaults followed by death, for some of the countries
of Europe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e61912src" href="#xd31e61912">520</a>

<p>The parallelism between the first two columns is undeniable; the states and provinces
with low figures for illiteracy show also a small number of assaults, and vice versa,
with some exceptions—notably Bavaria. The reason why Bavaria is at the head of the
list is undoubtedly because of the alcoholism that prevails there.

<p>Although less complete than in the preceding table, the parallelism here is nevertheless
striking; all the states below the average for illiteracy, except one, rank low also
in the number of murders. There are however some very remarkable exceptions to the
general tendency, some states with small figures for illiteracy having nevertheless
high figures for homicide. It is not possible for me to explain the cause of this,
the details with regard to this country being lacking (it is very remarkable that
the newest states are those that constitute the exceptions). The relation between
these crimes and illiteracy is undeniable however.

<p>We have here then a confirmation in a general way of the rule proved for other countries.
</p>
<p>In view of all the preceding data we must conclude that it is the less civilized persons
who commit crimes of this class. How is this to be explained? This is what we shall
proceed to examine.
</p>
<p>The first reason is that the more civilized a person is the less revengeful feelings
arise when some one injures him. The more the motives of actions are appreciated,
the less the desire for revenge springs up. A child wants to revenge himself even
upon an inanimate object that has hurt him; it is almost the same with uncivilized
peoples, who so rarely take account of the motives of human action. It is not so long
ago that men took vengeance upon maniacs, a thing which could not happen today.
</p>
<p>In the second place, when the idea of revenge arises in a civilized man he is more
in a position to restrain himself than the uncivilized; he is less impulsive; he knows
that later he will repent of his act, and that it may have disagreeable consequences
for him.
</p>
<p>In the third place civilization inspires a great aversion to acts of violence.
</p>
<p>Thus we come to the correlation between these crimes and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb636">[<a href="#pb636">636</a>]</span>education of the poor. The child is often moved to revenge, there is no inner check
to restrain his passions. When his education has been neglected he runs, as his age
advances, more danger than others of being guilty of these crimes. And then children
are very imitative. If we had good statistics with regard to violent criminals we
should see that they almost always spring from surroundings in which violence is common.
All authors who are especially concerned with this matter are in agreement on this
point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63421src" href="#xd31e63421">530</a> The fact that parents among the lower classes use blows as a means of instruction
has for its national consequence that when the children are grown they themselves
have no fear of making use of violence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63438src" href="#xd31e63438">531</a>
</p>
<p>One further observation must be made here. Many persons think it quite natural that
one should not have the right to avenge himself for an injury. Sociology, however,
teaches us quite otherwise. Among primitive peoples revenge, instead of being a thing
prohibited, is a sacred duty. Little by little vengeance, at first unlimited, became
confined to “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; this in turn was replaced by
the so called “<span class="corr" id="xd31e63449" title="Source: composition">compensation</span>”; and this in its turn yielded to penalties inflicted by an authority superior to
both parties.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63452src" href="#xd31e63452">532</a>
</p>
<p>If we enquire which are the countries where homicides and assaults are committed most
frequently we find that they are the most backward, and thus give a picture of time
past. Here we have in mind especially Sicily (see the table with regard to Italy some
pages higher) and Corsica (while between 1880 and 1884 there was an annual average
of 6.4 homicides to the million inhabitants, the figure for homicides in Corsica was
110.2). Nothing is more mistaken than to believe that we have here a question of race.
As Professor Tarde remarks (see the quotation on pp. 109–110), there have been times
when the people of these countries were much less violent than the northern peoples,
now so little given to this kind of crime. These two islands have so high a figure
because the “vendetta” is still universal there, and because it is considered as a
duty.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63464src" href="#xd31e63464">533</a>
</p>
<p>Although in less degree, the case is almost the same with the lower classes of other
countries as regards this type of crime. There are those who from their manner of
life most resemble our distant ancestors. <span class="pageNum" id="pb637">[<a href="#pb637">637</a>]</span>They are not, at least so much as other classes of society, instilled with the idea
that they have no right to avenge themselves personally. On the contrary it is often
considered an act of cowardice to allow an insult or an injury to pass without taking
revenge. This is why the police are often resisted and their interference considered
as an intrusive meddling with matters with which they have no concern.
</p>
<p>Such, in my opinion, are the principal reasons why the less civilized classes are
guilty of these crimes, and thus we are given an idea of their etiology.
</p>
<p>In the first table upon the relation between illiteracy and serious assaults (Germany)
we added also the percentage of votes given to the socialists. As the table shows
the percentage of these votes is in general smaller in the localities where the kind
of crime of which we have been treating is most frequent; and vice versa. It is, then,
evident that there is a correlation between the two phenomena, and this is easily
explained. In the working circles in which socialism is beginning to make its way,
there is growing little by little, an interest in things other than those which formerly
occupied the working-men in their leisure hours. They begin to <span class="corr" id="xd31e63479" title="Source: beome">become</span> civilized and to have an aversion to the coarser amusements. At the same time the
feeling of solidarity is awakened in them, and thus a powerful moral check is created.
</p>
<p>It was especially the figures for the crimes of vengeance that we placed beside those
<span class="corr" id="xd31e63484" title="Not in source">for </span>the votes given to the socialists, since the relation between the two phenomena stands
out very distinctly. This correlation, however, holds for criminality in general,
for almost all the countries with a large number of socialist voters show also fairly
low figures for criminality, and vice versa. Nevertheless this correlation is not
as great for other crimes as for those which we are at present considering, which
is explained by the fact that most of the criminals who are guilty of them are not
much like other criminals, especially those who have no respect for property (criminals
from poverty excepted). These last, greedy of pleasure, and always looking out for
their own interests, are those who, as regards the intensity of their social instincts,
occupy the last place. All this is inapplicable to criminals by violence; they are
not always really wicked, and after their crime they often show a sincere repentance.
Socialism exercises no influence upon the category of individuals from whom the economic
criminals (from cupidity) are recruited, persons, that is to say, who think only of
their own interest, and show themselves insensible to a movement for the well-being
of the whole working class.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb638">[<a href="#pb638">638</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have still to speak of one question which is sometimes put in treating of this
subject. If it is true, says some one, that it is principally in consequence of their
ignorance and their lack of civilization that the lower classes commit the crimes
in question, these crimes must little by little present themselves less often, for
the development of these classes is improving, even if only gradually. Now criminal
statistics do show a gradual diminution in these crimes. Homicide, the gravest form,
has continually decreased in England, Switzerland, France, and Sweden (where it has
been reduced to a very small figure), and in Italy (where a considerable diminution
has been shown).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63489src" href="#xd31e63489">534</a> If we had criminal statistics much more ancient than the existing ones it would be
shown that this crime has decreased enormously compared with remote epochs. The progress
of civilization in the lower strata of society is very slow, and criminal statistics
are all of relatively recent date.
</p>
<p>Germany is, as far as I know, the only country where there has been any considerable
increase in these crimes (except those against life) in the last twenty years. This
exception does not, in my opinion, invalidate the rule. The lack of civilization among
the lower orders is not the sole cause of these crimes; the innumerable conflicts
engendered by the present social system are also a cause. Besides, the impulse given
by the economic development in Germany during this period has hardly been equalled
in other countries; it has seen its population grow and become congested, and conflicts
increase in like proportion,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63509src" href="#xd31e63509">535</a> a cause sufficient to neutralize the civilization which brings it about. Further
there is the possibility that the police and the courts have been more efficient during
this period, so as to make the increase of crime seem greater than it really is.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63526src" href="#xd31e63526">536</a> Finally, alcoholism is increasing, and may also neutralize the effect of civilization.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63537src" href="#xd31e63537">537</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb639a">[<a href="#pb639a">639</a>]</span></p>
<p>We come, then, to one of the most important causes of this kind of crime, namely alcoholism.
Not only is chronic alcoholism demoralizing (as we have seen on pp. 509 <i>ff.</i>), but drunkenness at the acute stage makes a person more disposed to commit acts
of violence, and at the same time less able to control his instincts and passions.
Further, the degree of civilization reached by the individual has a great influence
upon his conduct when he is intoxicated; the civilized man is then much less dangerous
than the man without education. Dr. Grotjahn puts it as follows: “The development
of the moral consciousness is not without influence upon the harmlessness or danger
of intoxication. Persons in whom the sense of responsibility for the consequences
of their actions has been sharpened by education, whether they owe this to their teachers
or their parents or to their own experience, in case they become intoxicated to the
point of having their minds clouded, will still always keep a remnant of their power
of judgment, which will hold them back from violent and disastrous actions. On the
other hand, in the case of persons who lack all moral training, the scanty moral restraints
which check their native impulses most quickly disappear.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63557src" href="#xd31e63557">538</a>
</p>
<p>An examination of the physiological process caused by large doses of alcohol not coming
properly within the scope of a sociological work like this, it is sufficient to show
that great quantities of alcohol undoubtedly do have this effect.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63574src" href="#xd31e63574">539</a> We shall accordingly pass on to the question of the correlation between violent crime
and the acute stage of alcoholism.
</p>
<p>There are different ways of attempting to settle this question. In Part One we have
seen that some authors have tried the dynamic method, Fornasari di Verce, for example,
showing that in Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, and New South Wales, these crimes increase
and diminish with the consumption of alcohol. Professor Ferri shows that during the
years 1849–1880 the increase and diminution of cases of assault in France coincide
with the success and failure of the vintage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63612src" href="#xd31e63612">540</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb640">[<a href="#pb640">640</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another method consists in inquiring what day of the week assaults are most frequent.
If the abuse of alcohol is really an important factor in the etiology of these crimes
more of them must be committed upon Sunday, Saturday, and Monday, for the abuse of
alcohol is greatest on these days. The following table throws some light on the matter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63653src" href="#xd31e63653">541</a>

<p>The figures and the thesis agree, then, perfectly. It is plain, to be sure, that we
cannot charge all the cases falling on Sunday to alcohol, since people come together
more on that day, and hence the danger of a conflict is greater, but most of the Sunday
cases are certainly due to alcohol.
</p>
<p>Other authors compare the geography of these crimes with the consumption of alcohol.
Professor Aschaffenburg, for example, in the study already quoted, points out the
fact that in Germany the countries with the greatest number of assaults are also those
where there is the largest consumption of alcohol.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63835src" href="#xd31e63835">542</a>
</p>
<p>However, although these indirect methods are not without value, it seems to me that
since they contain so many elements of uncertainty they yield to the direct method.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e63848src" href="#xd31e63848">543</a> It is for this reason that I shall follow here especially the direct method and shall
indicate the percentage of those who have committed these crimes when they were in
a state of intoxication. Though making use of this direct method I do not think it
infallible, but it is less liable to error than the others. <span class="pageNum" id="pb641">[<a href="#pb641">641</a>]</span>The especial weakness of it is that the persons who are accused pretend in extenuation
that they committed their crimes in a state of drunkenness. Good statistics do not
rely solely upon the statements of the prisoners, but also upon the facts brought
out at the trial. And then, as Professor Löffler remarks, all those arraigned are
not acute enough to simulate a state of drunkenness, and there are even those who,
although addicted to overindulgence in alcohol, will deny that they were intoxicated,
either from shame, or for fear of a more severe punishment.
</p>
<p>Most criminal statistics do not concern themselves with this subject, and even those
that do are less detailed than we might wish. Nevertheless they are sufficient, I
believe, to prove the correlation in question.

<p class="subheading">Sweden, 1887–1897.
</p>
<p>During this period, out of 2,020 convicted of crimes against the authorities, 1,648,
or 81.5%, had committed their crimes in a state of intoxication, and 4,358, or 67.4%
out of 6,464 convicted of murder, homicide, and other crimes of violence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64124src" href="#xd31e64124">552</a>
</p>
<p class="subheading">Switzerland, 1892–1896.
</p>
<p>The official statistics for these years tell us that 34.8% of the assaults and homicides
were caused by alcohol.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64138src" href="#xd31e64138">553</a>
</p>
<p>It cannot be claimed, of course, that none of these crimes would have been committed
if their authors had not been drunk, but everyone will agree with me that these high
percentages show that acute alcoholism is a very important cause.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We have now reached the end of our remarks upon the etiology of these crimes, and
have shown that the principal causes are, first, the present structure of society,
which brings about innumerable conflicts; second, the lack of civilization and education
among the poorer classes; and third, alcoholism, which is in turn a consequence of
the social environment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64147src" href="#xd31e64147">554</a>
</p>
<p>What part is played in these crimes by the so-called individual factors? It seems
to me that it is like that which the individual factors play in other crimes—they
explain in part which are the individuals that commit the crimes, but they do not
explain why the crimes are committed.
</p>
<p>This is totally contrary to what many criminologists claim, namely that it is especially
the effect of individual factors that is seen in these crimes. Statistics prove the
inaccuracy of this. If it were true these crimes ought to appear equally in all classes
of society, which, as we have seen, is not the case. A choleric person naturally runs
more danger of committing such a crime than one who is phlegmatic; but no one will
deny that in all classes the proportion of the persons born with a choleric disposition
is the same. However, the influence of environment brings it about that in the well-to-do
classes even the <span class="pageNum" id="pb644">[<a href="#pb644">644</a>]</span>choleric run little danger of such a crime. Superficial civilization (for a veneer
is all that a great part of the bourgeoisie possesses) is sufficient to limit these
crimes to an insignificant minimum.
</p>
<p>The obviousness of the reasons which have caused these acts to be classed as crimes
is such that it is needless to speak of them. In a society like ours, with its numerous
conflicts and its dense population, life would be impossible if the individual were
not forbidden to avenge himself personally. Sociology teaches us that vengeance, at
first permitted, and even obligatory, has become a prohibited act, because of the
great harm it does to society.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64168src" href="#xd31e64168">555</a>

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">B.</span> <span class="sc">Infanticide.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are two chief motives for infanticide, which operate separately or together,
namely, fear of dishonor, and poverty. We shall speak first of the former and put
the question to begin with, what sort of persons are guilty of this crime? Criminal
statistics answer that—
</p>
<p>First, they are, almost without exception, women.
</p>
<p>Second, they are unmarried women much oftener than married.
</p>
<p>Third, the guilty are almost exclusively very poor. According to Italian statistics
88.1% of them are indigent; in Austria, 90.8%; and there are no rich or well-to-do
women among them.
</p>
<p>Fourth, the women of the working class are much more often guilty than those of the
independent class, and the class of domestics furnishes especially a very high figure
(Germany). These results are confirmed by the data of other countries. In Austria
80% of those convicted between 1880 and 1882 were domestics,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64189src" href="#xd31e64189">556</a> and in France the same was true of 35% of those convicted between 1876 and 1880.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64196src" href="#xd31e64196">557</a>
</p>
<p>Fifth, the women working in the fields are especially likely to fall into this crime
(Germany); the data of other countries also show that it is especially in the country
that infanticide is committed. Dr. Socquet shows that in France between 1871 and 1875
there were, to the million inhabitants, 35 persons arraigned out of the rural population,
and 22 to the urban.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64205src" href="#xd31e64205">558</a>
</p>
<p>Sixth, illiteracy is very frequent among those convicted of infanticide. We have seen
that in Austria 39.5%, in France 20.0%, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb645">[<a href="#pb645">645</a>]</span>in Italy 92.9% were illiterate. Women knowing more than how to read and write were
not found among these criminals.
</p>
<p>Most of the cases of infanticide are identical; it generally is, as Fournier says,
“a girl who has allowed herself to have a child without the permission of the municipality”,
and who has been abandoned by her lover.
</p>
<p>The ruling moral ideas place before her a frightful dilemma; if her pregnancy is known
by those about her and the child remains alive, she is covered with ignominy, and
a painful life awaits her. On the other hand if she makes the child disappear, the
others ignore everything, and she avoids dishonor and its consequences. She therefore
attempts to conceal her pregnancy as long as possible, in the hope of a miscarriage.
But when she finds herself disappointed, when not only terrible physical pains, but
also mental tortures are making her almost mad<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64216src" href="#xd31e64216">559</a>—then it happens that she kills her child.
</p>
<p>Statistics show that most of these crimes are committed by women of the lower classes.
The number of unmarried mothers is here relatively great; infanticide is quite rare
(though a little more frequent than one would suppose from the criminal statistics).
There must be special circumstances, therefore, to lead some of these women to this
crime. As we have seen in treating of marriage, the ideas of intimate relations between
persons who are not married are much less severe in the proletariat, than in the bourgeoisie
(a consequence of the fact that the social causes of marriage are much less strong
in the latter than in the former), so that among the proletariat these relations are
pretty common. If they have consequences, the father and mother generally marry. In
this case the idea of killing the child does not come to the woman. The unmarried
mothers (very often domestics), who are guilty of this crime are especially those
who, seduced and then abandoned by men of a higher class, have no family that can
receive them.
</p>
<p>Besides women of the working class, there are also among the infanticides some of
the petty bourgeoisie, where the moral disapproval of extra-matrimonial sexual commerce
is very severe.
</p>
<p>Not all women who find themselves in the situation described commit the crime in question,
of course. One will reason more than another, and will prefer dishonor to the danger
of a criminal trial; one woman has the maternal instinct more fully developed than
another, etc. In relation to the social sentiments we see here a situation <span class="pageNum" id="pb646">[<a href="#pb646">646</a>]</span>contrary to what occurs in the case of most crimes. Crime is an egoistic act, that
is to say an act which injures the interests of others. This is true of infanticide,
but this differs from most of the other crimes in being committed to escape moral
disapproval, while they are committed only to obtain a personal profit or to satisfy
the passions. This is why those guilty of infanticide are not generally those whose
social sentiments have little intensity, as is mostly the case with those who are
guilty of economic or sexual crimes. Infanticides are persons sensitive to the opinion
of others, while those who have little social feeling easily bear shame.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64238src" href="#xd31e64238">560</a>
</p>
<p>These individual differences explain in part which are the individuals who become
guilty of the crime in question, but not the cause of its existence. There are only
a few crimes whose social origin is as clear as that of infanticide. If the present
structure of society did not make the present form of marriage necessary, and thus
bring about moral disapprobation of extra-matrimonial sexual relations, there would
be no infanticide caused by fear of dishonor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64267src" href="#xd31e64267">561</a>
</p>
<p>The repression of some of the strongest <i>natural</i> desires, required by our present <i>society</i>, is so great that these requirements are bound to be violated by some individuals
in whom these desires are very pronounced. This is true not only in the sphere of
the economic life, but also in that of the sexual life. As long as cupidity is awakened
in many, while only a few can satisfy it, theft will exist; as long as the satisfaction
of the sexual desires is permitted only after certain economic conditions have been
complied with, the prohibition will be violated, and some persons will try to destroy
the evidence of their acts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64283src" href="#xd31e64283">562</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the fear of shame, poverty also plays a part in the etiology of infanticide.
Again, it is the two motives combined that are responsible. The great number of infanticides
among domestics are not committed simply from fear of shame, but also because the
mother, abandoned by everyone (especially in a country where inquiry into paternity
is prohibited) does not know how to support her child. Besides these cases there are
some committed from <span class="pageNum" id="pb647">[<a href="#pb647">647</a>]</span>poverty alone, for example when married women commit this crime (something, it should
be added, which happens very rarely).
</p>
<p>Some statistical data will show that poverty is a fairly important factor in the etiology
of infanticide. Dr. Weiss shows that in <i>Belgium</i> infanticide increased greatly in the years that were bad economically (see p. 63
of Pt. I), and Dr. Starke does the same for <i>Prussia</i> (see p. 66).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64307src" href="#xd31e64307">563</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>As we have pointed out above, infanticide for the cause of poverty was quite general
among primitive peoples, since they were not in a position to support a large population.
It was for this reason that the act was not considered immoral, and that it was even
required in some cases. In consequence of the continually increasing productivity
of labor, infanticide fell more and more into desuetude, and at the same time was
considered more and more reprehensible.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64318src" href="#xd31e64318">564</a>

<h3 class="main">POLITICAL CRIMES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally we have still to treat of political offenses, offenses which, in comparison
with others, occur very rarely, and which by their nature are totally different.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64360src" href="#xd31e64360">565</a>
</p>
<p>The origin of the state, and the possibility of political crimes, are bound up with
a certain phase of the development of the economic life, that is to say with the origin
of marked contrasts of fortune. Those who had monopolized the power in the state defended
their position by laws whose infraction was threatened with severe penalties. Economic
conditions, however, undergo considerable changes, and when these have reached a certain
degree, the oppressed class, having become the more powerful, breaks the political
power of the ruling class and seizes it for itself. If the dominant class does all
that it can to maintain its position unimpaired to the last moment, it will necessarily
happen that this development will lead to political crimes. This kind of political
crime may be called great political criminality. In western Europe the last great
struggle of this nature was that of the feudal classes and the bourgeoisie. The former,
once necessary, had become superfluous and harmful; the bourgeoisie on the other hand,
from an insignificant class had become the most important. It overturned the whole
political system which embarrassed it, seized the power, and transformed the state
according to the exigencies of the economic system. A repetition of the same process
in eastern Europe we are now witnessing in the changes going on in Russia. The economic
development no longer corresponds to the political system, <span class="pageNum" id="pb649">[<a href="#pb649">649</a>]</span>which sooner or later will inevitably be replaced by the modern system.
</p>
<p>It would be a waste of time to insist upon the fact that those who commit these acts
have nothing in common with ordinary criminals but the name. Most criminals are individuals
whose social sentiments are reduced to a minimum, and who injure others purely for
the satisfaction of their own desires. The political criminals of whom we are speaking,
on the other hand, are the direct opposite; they risk their most sacred interests,
their liberty and their life, for the benefit of society; they injure the ruling class
only to aid the oppressed classes, and consequently all humanity. While the ordinary
criminal is generally “<span lang="fr">l’homme canaille</span>” (as van Benedikt phrases it in his “<span lang="de">Biologie und Kriminalstatistik</span>”) the political criminal is “<span lang="la">homo nobilis</span>.” History rights the matter, for the name of the ordinary great criminal is pronounced
only with horror, and ends by falling into oblivion, while the political criminal
survives in the memory of posterity as a hero.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64387src" href="#xd31e64387">566</a>
</p>
<p>We must put in the same class the political criminals who aim to deliver a subjugated
people from their oppressors. The authors of these crimes also have nothing in common
with ordinary criminals.
</p>
<p>Besides these two kinds of political crimes, which are plainly collective in their
nature, there are cases of crimes committed by individuals which for the most part
are attempts upon the life of the monarch or of one of his representatives. The more
absolute a government, the more liberty is restricted, and the less chance there is,
consequently, of seeing the situation changed by legal means, the greater will become
the danger that one of those oppressed will kill the autocrat, either to better the
situation or to take revenge for what he and his have suffered. Anyone who wants to
follow the genesis of this kind of crime has only to turn to Russia. There all the
factors meet which lead to political homicide; the repression of all freedom, a corrupt
bureaucracy, and the impossibility of obtaining the least change by legal means.
</p>
<p>These circumstances naturally excite the revengeful feelings which sooner or later
show themselves in acts. Though we may have the conviction that these acts are almost
always useless, though we may have a deep aversion to violence—this does not justify
us in ranking those who do these things with ordinary criminals. It matters not <span class="pageNum" id="pb650">[<a href="#pb650">650</a>]</span>how we may abhor violence as such; every reasonable man will justify it when it serves
to defend oneself, and most of the acts of political criminals in Russia are only
acts of defense against the unheard-of cruelty and violence of the government.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64412src" href="#xd31e64412">567</a>
</p>
<p>Finally there remains a third kind of political crimes, analogous to ordinary crime,
the assassination of the monarch by individuals who thus attempt to place themselves
in power. These are actuated by the same vile motives that inspire the robber-murderer—cupidity,
desire to dominate, etc.
</p>
<p>Now what are the political crimes committed in our days? Leaving aside the case of
Russia, which is still living in an epoch that western Europe has left behind, there
are only the political crimes of socialists and anarchists. There is little to be
said about those committed by socialists. The international social democracy attempts
to reach its end by legal means. Since the fall of absolutism it has been possible
to exercise an influence on the state in this way, an influence which varies with
the country. It is this possibility that the social democracy makes use of. In conformity
with its fundamental principles it rejects all violence against the head of the state.
Accordingly its partisans have never committed such acts. The more democratic the
constitution of a country, the less justification the social democracy will have for
political crimes, as in Switzerland, for example, a country where the penal code,
moreover, mentions but few political crimes. In other countries, where the democratic
institutions are weak, where the constitutional monarchy has still an absolutist character,
and where social democracy has become powerful, as in Germany, political crimes are
inevitable. Their number, however, is insignificant in comparison with ordinary crimes.
From a criminological point of view they have little importance, though often punished
severely, and they are generally limited to the crime of leze majesty. Social democrats
are, then, sometimes guilty of minor political offenses, and in some countries only.
Whether this party will not in the future be guilty of crime of the great political
type, or, in other words, whether it will not come to political revolution, is another
question and one that no one can answer with certainty. Like all the bourgeoisie when
the contest with the feudal classes was still going on, the social democrats are a
revolutionary class; they wish to place society upon a basis different from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb651">[<a href="#pb651">651</a>]</span>present one. It is possible that in democratic countries they will attain this by
legal means, and consequently without there being any reason for political crime.
However, it may also happen that at a given moment when the proletariat forms the
majority of the legislative body, the ruling class may have recourse to a “<span lang="fr">coup d’état</span>”, to a political crime, in order to prevent the proletariat from governing. This
possibility is even a probability in some countries, where the opposition of classes
is very marked. In Germany, for example, where the social democracy is very powerful,
it is very likely that the government will attempt some day to suppress universal
suffrage by a “<span lang="fr">coup d’état</span>.” It is only in such a case that the social democracy will in its turn abandon the
legal way and be forced to have recourse to other methods.
</p>
<p>In the second place there are the political crimes of anarchists. Their number is
not great enough for us to learn their etiology from statistics.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64450src" href="#xd31e64450">568</a> We must therefore analyze individual cases. What are the individuals that are guilty
of these? The anarchists of the propaganda are most exclusively young men. Leauthier
and Langs were 20 years old, Angelillo also, Henry 21, Caserio 21, Schwabe 23, Pallas
24, Lucheni 25, Vaillant and Bresci 31, and Salvador 33, at the time they committed
their crimes, and as far as I know there were none of them who were over 33. In disposition
they were very excitable. As soon as an idea took hold of them they thought of nothing
else. Chance brought them into contact with anarchism which immediately made a conquest
of them. Brought up in another environment they would have become, for example, religious
devotees; in fact Caserio, Salvador, Vaillant, Cyvoct, and Henry were such before
becoming anarchists.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64476src" href="#xd31e64476">569</a>
</p>
<p>Extreme individualism is also a characteristic of theirs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64488src" href="#xd31e64488">570</a> They abhor discipline, from which it follows that they nourish a fierce hatred of
militarism. Even a mild form of discipline, such as that of a party of which one voluntarily
becomes a member, is insupportable to them. Some of them have been socialists, but
have soon left the party. Among these was Henry, who says in his defense: “For an
instant I was attracted by socialism, but I did not delay in separating myself from
this party. I had too much love for liberty, too much respect for individual initiative,
too much repugnance to <span class="pageNum" id="pb652">[<a href="#pb652">652</a>]</span>incorporation, to take a number in the enlisted army of the fourth estate.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64499src" href="#xd31e64499">571</a>
</p>
<p>Another characteristic of nearly all active anarchists, and one intimately connected
with the preceding, is great vanity. Lucheni, for instance, in speaking of his crime
said, “I wanted to kill a person of note, because that would get into print.” Vaillant
had himself photographed before making his attack, distributed his portraits right
and left, and when arrested asked whether the journals had printed his picture, etc.
</p>
<p>These traits of character, observed in the case of these individuals, are not rare;
vain and excitable individualists are fairly numerous, yet almost none become active
anarchists. We must therefore seek the explanation elsewhere, and ask ourselves the
question, in what environment have they lived? When the president of the tribunal
before which Lucheni appeared, asked him what was the motive that led him to commit
his act, he replied, “It was poverty.” This is applicable to almost all the active
anarchists. See, for example, the life of Vaillant. An illegitimate child without
any education, he had to earn his living at the age of 12; having escaped from his
employer, with whom he was living, he implored his mother to take him in. Rebuffed
he had himself arrested by the police, but when he was once more brought back to his
parents they refused anew to receive him. He tried to make his own way, but failed
in all that he undertook. It was when embittered by all the miseries he had experienced
that he became acquainted with socialism, but finding this too theoretical he ranked
himself on the side of the anarchists, and the last link in this chain of misery was
his well-known crime.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64509src" href="#xd31e64509">572</a>
</p>
<p>There are authors who claim that poverty is not to be considered as one of the principal
causes of anarchy, and in support of their assertion cite the case of Henry and some
others, who while not living in easy circumstances, yet did not know the blackest
poverty. Those who reason thus have a false notion of the motives that impel anarchists.
It is not only the poverty that they have themselves experienced that moves them,
but also, and chiefly, the poverty of others. Those who remain insensible to the sufferings
of their neighbors never become anarchists; for not being able to draw any personal
profit from anarchism, they consider it madness. Placed in unfavorable conditions
such persons become ordinary criminals, or commit suicide. They never sacrifice themselves
for an ideal.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb653">[<a href="#pb653">653</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus we come to another psychological trait of the anarchists, namely that they are
born with pronounced altruistic tendencies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64524src" href="#xd31e64524">573</a> It is their altruism which separates them from the ordinary great criminal, whose
social instincts are very weak.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64538src" href="#xd31e64538">574</a>
</p>
<p>It seems paradoxical to say that persons who commit such acts are of an altruistic
nature, but the paradox is only apparent. When two persons, an egoist and an altruist,
see a child being maltreated, the former goes on his way saying that he would only
get himself into trouble if he interfered; the latter, on the other hand, delivers
the child from his tormentor, to whom he may give a good thrashing in addition. Here
the violent person is the altruist, the other the egoist. Every comparison is imperfect,
and this is the case with the one before us, but there is some analogy between the
act cited and those of the anarchists. The crimes which they commit are egoistic towards
certain persons, but altruistic with reference to others. As a consequence of their
own poverty and of the irritation they feel when they see that of their fellows, they
have been seized with a hatred of society and wish to avenge themselves. These sentiments
are not tempered by much intellectual development. This is a very important factor
in the development of active anarchism. Almost all these persons are either very ignorant
or have only an elementary education, some know a little more, and persons of thorough
education are not found at all among them. Further, most of them lack pronounced intellectual
aptitudes, but are rather especially impulsive.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64547src" href="#xd31e64547">575</a>
</p>
<p>These individuals, excitable, vain, with little intellectual capacity, and ignorant
in addition, but oppressed by their own poverty and that of others, and filled with
a hatred of society, come into contact with anarchism. It is unnecessary to give an
exposition of this doctrine;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64603src" href="#xd31e64603">576</a> the active anarchists in their ignorance get no clear idea of <span class="pageNum" id="pb654">[<a href="#pb654">654</a>]</span>any theory whatever, and certainly not of anything as vague and confused as anarchism.
They have heard it said that it looks to the formation of a society of altruists where
there will be no more poverty, and this appeals to their altruistic instincts; at
the same time anarchism gives a preponderating part to the individual, and this draws
their vanity. Thus their hate increases, and at the same time attaches itself to certain
individuals, whom anarchism holds responsible for existing conditions. Further, the
absurd opinion has been instilled into them that it is possible for society to be
reorganized at a single stroke, and that to attain this end it will be necessary to
use violence.
</p>
<p>Is it astonishing that such individuals come to attempt homicide? No; to be sure all
persons of this kind do not go so far; for that it would be necessary that other conditions
should be complied with. It is plain that persons with a great aversion to violence
would run little risk of attempting an assassination<span class="corr" id="xd31e64631" title="Source: ,">;</span> with others it is courage that is lacking; others still attach too high a price to
life and liberty to be willing to risk them; etc. We must note this last point especially.
Generally active anarchists are persons who care nothing for a life in which they
have nothing further to lose. Their conduct in court and their indifference in the
face of death are proof of this; knowing beforehand that they will almost certainly
not go unpunished their act is often an indirect suicide.
</p>
<p>If we ask what the active anarchists wish to attain by their crimes the answer is
principally that they wish to avenge upon society the misery experienced by others
and by themselves,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64636src" href="#xd31e64636">577</a> they wish to terrorize the ruling classes, in order to force upon them social reforms;
they wish to set an example to the working classes and finally, they wish to satisfy
their vanity, by making themselves talked of. Once committed, the crime is often the
commencement of a vicious circle, since society avenges itself upon the author, who,
in turn, is avenged by his friends; imitation thus leading to new crimes.
</p>
<p>As in the case of all other crimes, I find for anarchism only social causes, and in
the last analysis, only economic causes. To be sure, the individuals who commit these
crimes are already predisposed in that direction, but this is true of other crimes
also. Only the predisposition in these latter is simple, while that which leads to
anarchistic crimes is much more complex. However, this predisposition alone explains
nothing. I would ask those who think that only individual factors play any part, whether
fanatical persons with <span class="pageNum" id="pb655">[<a href="#pb655">655</a>]</span>all the characteristics of the anarchists of our time have not been found in all ages
and countries. Everyone, I think, will answer in the affirmative. Well then, anarchistic
crimes have occurred only during a certain period and in certain countries. No one
can deny that there are as many persons predisposed to anarchistic crimes in a country
like Germany, as there are in Italy, for example. Yet anarchistic crimes do not occur
in Germany, for the good reason that the material conditions of the proletariat there
are so much better than in Italy, and the degree of intellectual development in the
working people is so much higher; the German working-man derides the “naïveté” of
the anarchists, and detests their futile crimes. It is in the environment alone then
that we find the causes of active anarchism, the poverty and ignorance in which the
lower classes live.

<h3 class="label">CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h3 class="main">PATHOLOGICAL CRIMES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far we have been examining crime in its relation to the economic and social environment.
We have not been able to discover the existence of individual factors; the celebrated
formula, “crime = individual factor + social factor,” has been shown to be incorrect
if we are seeking for the causes of crime instead of asking why a certain individual
has become a criminal. The conclusion obtained by sociology is the same as that arrived
at in anthropology by authors like Manouvrier, Baer, and Näcke.
</p>
<p>However, when one is trying to determine the cause of crime by sociology, certain
cases are at times met with that cannot be explained in this way. For example, one
person will steal useless objects which he is perfectly well able to buy; another
will assault or kill without provocation, etc. These cases, it is true, are the exception,
but they do exist and must not be neglected.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64661src" href="#xd31e64661">578</a> We have here, then, real individual factors, factors which are found in certain individuals
only. Other crimes, forming the great majority, are committed from motives which form
the basis of all human acts, but are stronger with some few than they are with the
general body of mankind. It is these individuals who run more danger than most of
committing a crime when they live in a certain environment. The great mass of criminals
differ only quantitatively from persons who never get into the courts; the criminals
we are about to consider on the other hand differ qualitatively also.
</p>
<p>One thing more before we ask ourselves what this individual factor is. As many authors
have remarked, it very often happens that, even in the cases we are about to treat,
there is a social factor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64666src" href="#xd31e64666">579</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb657a">[<a href="#pb657a">657</a>]</span>The proof of this is that individuals thus disposed to crime, but belonging to the
well-to-do classes, seldom get to the point of committing them; because their education
being better, the tendency is sooner noticed, they are better watched, and thus their
committing a crime is often avoided. Born-criminals, in the sense of those who become
criminals <i>whatever the circumstances may be</i> (the only meaning that can properly be given to the word “born” here), are doubtless
very rare.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64725src" href="#xd31e64725">580</a>
</p>
<p>What, then, is the nature of this individual factor? It is especially the Italian
school that has busied itself with this problem, and in doing so has rendered a service
to science, although it has given an undue importance to this individual factor, attempting
to discover it in all crimes. The first hypothesis given by Professor Lombroso was
that of atavism, according to which the criminal was an individual in whom reappeared
the characteristics of his remote ancestors, the desire to steal, kill, etc. It will
not be far from the truth if we assert that almost no reputable scientist now accepts
this hypothesis as correct. It has been attacked both from the side of sociology and
from that of anthropology. Sociologists have proved that the facts contradict Professor
Lombroso’s thesis, for primitive peoples are neither thieves nor murderers, and our
ancestors, consequently, may be regarded as cleared of the same charge.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64759src" href="#xd31e64759">581</a>
</p>
<p>Anthropologists also are strongly opposed to this hypothesis. In his article, “<span lang="nl">De geboren misdadiger</span>” (the born-criminal) Professor Jelgersma says that most of the anomalies observed
in certain criminals have no atavistic character, such as unsymmetrical eyes and ears,
abnormal growth of hair, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64779src" href="#xd31e64779">582</a> Dr. A. Baer makes the same remark in his “<span lang="de">Der Verbrecher in anthropologischer Beziehung</span>”, and goes on as follows: “The number of such abnormalities, which betray a disordered
and an apparently <span class="corr" id="xd31e64788" title="Source: geniune">genuine</span> atavistic condition, is … so small and so accidental, that no force can be recognized
in them that <span class="pageNum" id="pb658">[<a href="#pb658">658</a>]</span>might serve for the explanation of criminality, or establish a causal connection with
the criminal nature of an individual. Out of this mixture of stigmata of the most
various origin and importance, to attempt to find the sole basis in their atavistic
character is to do more than permissible violence to the facts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64794src" href="#xd31e64794">583</a>
</p>
<p>After this beginning the Italian school put forth another explanation, to which it
attached the more importance as the hypothesis of atavism fell into discredit: the
criminal is either an epileptic or morally insane. Although the correctness of this
hypothesis has not been proved any more than the other,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64823src" href="#xd31e64823">584</a> the Italian school here found itself in a field recognized by criminal-anthropologists
as its true one. At present one has even the right to say that the opinion in this
regard is almost unanimous.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64859src" href="#xd31e64859">585</a> <i>The origin of the tendencies of part of the criminals is to be found in the pathological
nature of the individuals themselves.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64877src" href="#xd31e64877">586</a> These are disordered or degenerate, not, as some authors would have us believe, individuals
differing more or less from the average, but persons who suffer from mental diseases,
or whose nervous system is affected.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64886src" href="#xd31e64886">587</a>
</p>
<p>Among those disordered and degenerate, some individuals<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64893src" href="#xd31e64893">588</a> have tendencies not found in others (such as the desire to kill for the sake of killing),
or their moral sentiments are excessively weak. It is to be noticed that we have met
with degeneracy above, as it is to be named among the causes of alcoholism and prostitution
also. In treating of economic crimes we saw that degenerates also run more danger
than others of succumbing in the struggle for existence, and hence become criminals
more easily. Thus we meet degeneracy both as a direct and as an indirect cause of
crime.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb659">[<a href="#pb659">659</a>]</span></p>
<p>We might leave the matter here, for we have come to a field other than that of sociology.
However, one more question presents itself. To what extent are the economic system
and its consequences the cause of these maladies? It is plain that this important
question belongs in a work on sociology. We shall accordingly attempt to answer it
briefly with the aid of competent authorities.
</p>
<p>First of all, we note that heredity plays a great part in these maladies. The authors
who have taken up the subject agree. It has been remarked that:
</p>
<p>First, the inheritance of defects is not inevitable; degenerate parents may have sound
children, though the chances are not very great.
</p>
<p>Second, the disease of the parents is not always transmitted as such to the child,
but the child may be predisposed to this same disease or one analogous. Dr. Féré expresses
this as follows: “The diseases of the nervous system … make up a single family, indissolubly
united by the laws of heredity … everyone (of those who have these diseases), if he
is still fertile, can reproduce them all.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64918src" href="#xd31e64918">589</a>
</p>
<p>In speaking of heredity we come to the first relation between the diseases in question
and the social environment, since, in our present society, human reproduction is intimately
bound up with the economic life. A person who is diseased but rich is often in a position
to marry and procreate, while he would have had a smaller chance if sexual selection
alone had been effective. On the other hand many well and strong individuals are prevented
at present from establishing a family, since they lack the means to support it.
</p>
<p>A second harmful kind of selection in our present society is found in the effect of
militarism, which takes the strongest individuals, decimates them in time of war,
or returns them to society weakened and diseased, while the weak have the greater
chance to procreate.
</p>
<p>In the third place, the ignorance of the harmful effects for humanity of the reproduction
of degenerates is one of the principal reasons why degeneracy is so frequently present.
This ignorance is great in the well-to-do classes, and naturally greater still among
the poor. It is often repeated, and with truth, that man takes great care to improve
his live stock by selection but takes none whatever in the matter of his own race;
the weak and the diseased continue to reproduce themselves to the detriment of all
society. The lack of all feeling of responsibility, natural to our intensely individualistic
society, also <span class="pageNum" id="pb660">[<a href="#pb660">660</a>]</span>contributes its share toward bringing to birth so many unhappy creatures for whom
it would have been better if they had never existed.
</p>
<p>If we ask how it happens that one individual or another is degenerate, we must answer
that very often this degeneracy is due to heredity, either in part or altogether.
But if we enquire into the causes of degeneracy in general heredity ceases to be a
cause. As Professor Dallemagne says: “Heredity creates nothing; from heredity to heredity
we must still go back to the cause.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64934src" href="#xd31e64934">590</a>
</p>
<p>What are at present the principal characteristics of the relation between degeneracy
and the present economic system with its consequences? Some authors in treating of
the etiology of degeneracy express themselves only in general terms, and point out
no other cause than “unfavorable circumstances.” Professor Jelgersma, for example,
says: “The simple psychoses, melancholia, mania, etc. are caused by unfavorable circumstances.
The cause of the psychoses of degeneracy is deeper; the unfavorable circumstances
have exercised their influence from generation to generation, and thus an individual
is born who is abnormal from birth.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64942src" href="#xd31e64942">591</a>
</p>
<p>These unfavorable circumstances must be more precisely defined, therefore. We shall
divide them into four great groups.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64953src" href="#xd31e64953">592</a>
</p>
<p>First. <i>The material condition of the poor classes.</i> “To be well,” says Dr. Toulouse, “one must be sufficiently fed, must clothe himself
according to the season, be clean, not work beyond one’s strength, and be more or
less exempt from care.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64979src" href="#xd31e64979">593</a> This is a simple truth of which all the world is convinced when it is a question
of themselves or of their families, but which the physicians forget only too often
when they are speaking of the social causes of diseases.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e64985src" href="#xd31e64985">594</a>
</p>
<p>In the first place the poor classes are badly and insufficiently fed, and as a consequence
grow weak, and the children born to them are inferior physically and mentally. The
insufficient nourishment of the mother during her pregnancy, and the insufficient
nourishment of <span class="pageNum" id="pb661">[<a href="#pb661">661</a>]</span>the child during the first years of his life, are especially fatal to him. Then those
who are badly fed are predisposed to tuberculosis, scrofula, and rickets, which, in
their turn, may be the causes of degeneracy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65001src" href="#xd31e65001">595</a> Rickety women often have a contraction of the pelvis, which hinders child-birth,
and may cause a lesion to the infant’s brain. Note, for example, the opinion of Dr.
Näcke, who says: “The social misery, bad hygiene and food … often enough beget a miserable
generation and must already have injured the germ. The same causes, however, on the
other hand easily produce feeble women with qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient
milk, and most of all with a narrow pelvis, through which births take place with difficulty
and to the detriment of the brain of the child. If now the above named factors come
in later to affect the child, the derangement of nutrition will be further increased,
and it is no wonder if all kinds of rickety and scrofulous symptoms appear in the
body, and all kinds of children’s ailments injure both body and mind.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65010src" href="#xd31e65010">596</a>
</p>
<p>In the second place, unsanitary dwellings and insufficient clothing are the cause
of all sorts of diseases, especially tuberculosis, which in their turn may lead to
degeneracy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65018src" href="#xd31e65018">597</a> The density of population in the great cities exercises its influence in the same
direction.
</p>
<p>In the third place, the long duration and intensity of the work forced upon the proletariat
also contribute to degeneracy. For each individual there is a fixed measure of labor
that he cannot pass without experiencing harmful consequences in body and mind. Dr.
Lewy describes them as follows: “The consequences of immoderately long hours of labor
are, a certain overexcitement of the nervous system<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> which later gives place to a permanent debility, with which may be associated a dull
headache as well as an inability to think clearly. If the overwork continues for a
longer time, soon all the systems of the body are affected, the heart and larger arteries
as well are injured in structure and function, disturbances of the regular circulation
appear, manifested partly in swellings in various parts of the body, especially in
the feet, and partly through hemorrhages. The brain ceases to function regularly,
and so-called brain-symptoms appear, such as vertigo, ringing in the ears, deafness,
defective vision, paralysis, and apoplexy. In the same way the liver, kidneys, and
the digestive tract may be drawn into the general weakening process. The muscles become
weak and slack, the body disposed to epidemic <span class="pageNum" id="pb662">[<a href="#pb662">662</a>]</span>diseases, but especially prepared to vocational diseases, to which persons in a run-down
condition most easily fall victim. If, then<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> the end of the worker is not brought about prematurely by some intercurrent disease
like typhus, under the immoderate strain he uses up his existing forces faster than
he is in a position to replace them, and wastes away with tuberculosis of the lungs,
so much the quicker, of course, the weaker he is constitutionally, and the younger
he was when he had to submit to excessive labor.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65033src" href="#xd31e65033">598</a>
</p>
<p>The harmful consequences of long working hours make themselves felt especially in
the trades which are already dangerous to health, like those where there is a great
deal of dust produced, or those which use poisons like lead, mercury, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65043src" href="#xd31e65043">599</a> Monotony of work joined with long hours is also a cause of physical and intellectual
deterioration. Professor Vogt says: “The less variety work presents, the more fatiguing
is it, since it is only the same part of the muscles that are continually called upon,
while the rest of the muscular system, in accordance with a well-known physiological
law, degenerates from misuse and wastes away. To a still higher degree the uniformity
of work has a deteriorating effect upon the mental powers; these become weakened much
more quickly in the case of long continued fatigue than the muscles, while the unexercised
mental faculties at the same time become stunted.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65053src" href="#xd31e65053">600</a>
</p>
<p>The present economic system has also led to the work of women and children, and consequently
to an important cause of the degeneration of the race. The number of women forced
to take part in trades for which they are ill-fitted by nature is very great. The
fear of being discharged, and the impossibility of doing without their wages make
women with child continue to work up to the last moment of their pregnancy, and recommence
shortly after childbirth, leading to very harmful results both for them and for their
children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65064src" href="#xd31e65064">601</a> Then child labor prevents the normal development of the children and ages them prematurely.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65073src" href="#xd31e65073">602</a>
</p>
<p>Further, the cares and restlessness consequent upon the uncertainty of life may be
causes of the weakening of the nervous system and the origin of a neurosis.
</p>
<p>Finally, when an individual of this class falls sick his restoration to <span class="pageNum" id="pb663">[<a href="#pb663">663</a>]</span>health may be hindered by the lack of care and medical assistance and the necessity
of recommencing work too soon.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65087src" href="#xd31e65087">603</a>
</p>
<p>Second. <i>The condition of the well-to-do classes.</i> Most of the causes producing degeneracy in the poor classes do not appear among the
well-to-do. With the latter there can be no question of insufficient food or clothing,
or of bad housing. Yet in the well-to-do classes the idle, from their manner of living
and this lack of regular exercise, are led to excesses of all kinds, which may make
them too, in another way, subject to degeneracy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65145src" href="#xd31e65145">604</a>
</p>
<p>In the active part of the bourgeoisie, among the manufacturers, merchants, etc., the
case is different. They are constantly absorbed in the question of how to increase
their wealth, or, if they are unfortunate, they live in fear of losing the position
gained. They are in a state of agitation, of permanent overexcitement. So there are
numbers in the bourgeois class who overtax their minds, with the resulting chance
of neurasthenia, even where the individual is not predisposed to it. All this applies
also to the liberal professions, though in a smaller degree; there also the great
competition has harmful consequences for the nerves. In “<span lang="fr">La famille névropathique</span>” Dr. Féré thus describes the consequences of overdriving: “… excessive cerebral labor,
intellectual and, still more, moral overwork, the continual preoccupations of the
struggle for existence are conditions eminently fit to bring on functional troubles
in the nervous system. Neurasthenia, like hysteria, may be considered as a chronic
fatigue. The fatigue, to be sure, gives place to a number of troubles peculiar to
neurasthenia. And these troubles, even if only temporary, cannot fail to have the
most harmful effect upon children conceived under these conditions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65163src" href="#xd31e65163">605</a>
</p>
<p>The opinion of the celebrated alienist Maudsley is also very interesting; he says:
“Perhaps one, and certainly not the least, of the ill effects which spring from some
of the conditions of our present civilization, is seen in the general dread and disdain
of poverty, in the eager passion to become rich. The practical gospel of the age,
testified <span class="pageNum" id="pb664">[<a href="#pb664">664</a>]</span>everywhere by faith and works, is that of money-getting; men are estimated mainly
by the amount of their wealth, take social rank accordingly, and consequently bend
all their energies to acquire that which gains them esteem and influence. The result
is that in the higher departments of trade and commerce speculations of all sorts
are eagerly entered on, and that many people are kept in a continued state of excitement
and anxiety by the fluctuations of the money market. In the lower branches of trade
there is the same eager desire for petty gains; and the continued absorption of the
mind in these small acquisitions generates a littleness of mind and meanness of spirit,
where it does not lead to actual dishonesty, which are nowhere displayed in a more
pitiable form than by certain petty tradesmen. The occupation which a man is entirely
engaged in does not fail to modify his character, and the reaction upon the individual’s
nature of a life which is being spent with the sole aim of becoming rich, is most
baneful. It is not that the fluctuations of excitement unhinge the merchant’s mind
and lead to maniacal outbreaks, although that does sometimes happen; it is not that
failure in the paroxysm of some crisis prostrates his energies and makes him melancholic,
although that also is occasionally witnessed; but it is that exclusiveness of his
life-aim and occupation too often saps the moral or altruistic element in his nature,
makes him become egoistic, formal, and unsympathetic, and in his person deteriorates
the nature of humanity. What is the consequence? If one conviction has been fixed
in my mind more distinctly than another by observation of instances, it is that it
is extremely unlikely such a man will beget healthy children; on the contrary, it
is extremely likely that the deterioration of nature which he has acquired will be
transmitted as an evil heritage to his children. In several instances in which the
father has toiled upwards from poverty to vast wealth, with the aim and hope of founding
a family, I have witnessed the results in a degeneracy, mental and physical, of his
offspring, which has sometimes gone as far as extinction of the family in the third
or fourth generation. When the evil is not so extreme as madness or ruinous vice,
the savour of a mother’s influence having been present, it may still be manifest in
an instinctive cunning and duplicity, and an extreme selfishness of nature—a nature
not having the capacity of a true moral conception or altruistic feeling. Whatever
opinion other more experienced observers may hold, I cannot but think, after what
I have seen, that the extreme passion for getting rich, absorbing the whole energies
of life, does predispose to mental degeneration in the offspring—either to moral defect,
or to <span class="pageNum" id="pb665">[<a href="#pb665">665</a>]</span>moral and intellectual deficiency, or to outbreaks of positive insanity under the
conditions of life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65172src" href="#xd31e65172">606</a>
</p>
<p>We could cite a number of other competent authorities to prove that the present economic
system exacts from those who direct production also, intellectual efforts such as
the nervous system cannot endure indefinitely.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65178src" href="#xd31e65178">607</a>
</p>
<p>Third. <i>Syphilis.</i> Aside from the fact that this malady is very probably the cause of general paralysis,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65219src" href="#xd31e65219">608</a> it takes its place among the important factors of degeneracy to this extent, that
the children of syphilitics are often degenerates. This fact being generally recognized
we shall not dwell on it. The celebrated German specialist in syphilis, Blaschko,
says of it: “Syphilis leads to the birth of children who are mentally and physically
stunted, and often crippled and imbecile.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65227src" href="#xd31e65227">609</a>
</p>
<p>This would not be the time to speak of syphilis as a cause of degeneracy, if the extension
of this malady were not intimately bound up with prostitution, which is, in its turn,
determined by the economic environment. Dr. Blaschko says of it: “The principal source
of venereal infection of course is, and remains, sexual intercourse outside of wedlock,
especially prostitution.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65252src" href="#xd31e65252">610</a>
</p>
<p>As a social cause of the great extension of syphilis it is well to point out the profound
ignorance of the extent and the danger of venereal diseases,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65272src" href="#xd31e65272">611</a> to which less attention is paid than to others (hospitals not receiving patients
affected by them, relief funds not aiding those having syphilis, etc.). Like other
diseases these have the most harmful consequences for those who live under bad conditions.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65284src" href="#xd31e65284">612</a>
</p>
<p>Fourth. <i>Alcoholism.</i> Alcoholism undoubtedly belongs to the very important causes of degeneracy. There
are few questions upon which competent authors are as unanimous as they are upon this.
There is <span class="pageNum" id="pb666">[<a href="#pb666">666</a>]</span>a wealth of material for quotation but we will limit ourselves to the words of Professor
Dallemagne, who, after quoting the opinion of such authorities as Morel, Magnan, and
others concludes by saying: “Alcohol is an essential factor of degeneracy. It can
by itself create all the degenerate and unbalanced states, and this question appears
definitely decided.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65297src" href="#xd31e65297">613</a> Dr. Legrain gives the following figures upon the consequences of chronic alcoholism
of the parents upon the children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65303src" href="#xd31e65303">614</a> Out of 215 families of alcoholics in four generations (814 individuals) there were
found: 42% of alcoholics, 60.9% of degenerates, 13.9% morally insane, 22.7% had had
convulsions, 20% were hysterical or epileptic, and 19% were insane.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65311src" href="#xd31e65311">615</a> These are striking figures, and banish all doubt of the harmful influence of alcohol!
</p>
<p>It must still further be observed, that the very frequent adulteration of alcohol
leads to especially harmful consequences;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65349src" href="#xd31e65349">616</a> and that alcohol exerts an especially harmful effect upon the ill-nourished.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e65360src" href="#xd31e65360">617</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We have come now to the end of our remarks upon the social and economic causes of
degeneracy. Although they are plainly not the only ones, yet it is certain that their
part in the etiology of degeneracy is very important, and even preponderating.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb667">[<a href="#pb667">667</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch2.2.7" class="div2 last-child chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e1363">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="label">CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<h3 class="main">CONCLUSIONS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What are the conclusions to be drawn from what has gone before? When we sum up the
results that we have obtained it becomes plain that economic conditions occupy a much
more important place in the etiology of crime than most authors have given them.
</p>
<p>First we have seen that the present economic system and its consequences weaken the
social feelings. The basis of the economic system of our day being exchange, the economic
interests of men are necessarily found to be in opposition. This is a trait that capitalism
has in common with other modes of production. But its principal characteristic is
that the means of production are in the hands of a few, and most men are altogether
deprived of them. Consequently, persons who do not possess the means of production
are forced to sell their labor to those who do, and these, in consequence of their
economic preponderance, force them to make the exchange for the mere necessaries of
life, and to work as much as their strength permits.
</p>
<p>This state of things especially stifles men’s social instincts; it develops, on the
part of those with power, the spirit of domination, and of insensibility to the ills
of others, while it awakens jealousy and servility on the part of those who depend
upon them. Further the contrary interests of those who have property, and the idle
and luxurious life of some of them, also contribute to the weakening of the social
instincts.
</p>
<p>The material condition, and consequently the intellectual condition, of the proletariat
are also a reason why the moral plane of that class is not high. The work of children
brings them into contact with persons to associate with whom is fatal to their morals.
Long working hours and monotonous labor brutalize those who are forced into them;
bad housing conditions contribute also to debase the moral sense, as do the uncertainty
of existence, and finally absolute poverty, the frequent consequence of sickness and
unemployment. Ignorance <span class="pageNum" id="pb668">[<a href="#pb668">668</a>]</span>and lack of training of any kind also contribute their quota. Most demoralizing of
all is the status of the lower proletariat.
</p>
<p>The economic position of woman contributes also to the weakening of the social instincts.
</p>
<p>The present organization of the family has great importance as regards criminality.
It charges the legitimate parents with the care of the education of the child; the
community concerns itself with the matter very little. It follows that a great number
of children are brought up by persons who are totally incapable of doing it properly.
As regards the children of the proletariat, there can be no question of the education
properly so-called, on account of the lack of means and the forced absence of one
or both of the parents. The school tends to remedy this state of things, but the results
do not go far enough. The harmful consequences of the present organization of the
family make themselves felt especially in the case of the children of the lower proletariat,
orphans, and illegitimate children. For these the community does but little, though
their need of adequate help is the greatest.
</p>
<p>Prostitution, alcoholism, and militarism, which result, in the last analysis, from
the present social order, are phenomena that have demoralizing consequences.
</p>
<p>As to the different kinds of crime, we have shown that the very important group of
economic criminality finds its origin on the one side in the absolute poverty and
the cupidity brought about by the present economic environment, and on the other in
the moral abandonment and bad education of the children of the poorer classes. Then,
professional criminals are principally recruited from the class of occasional criminals,
who, finding themselves rejected everywhere after their liberation, fall lower and
lower. The last group of economic crimes (fraudulent bankruptcy, etc.) is so intimately
connected with our present mode of production, that it would not be possible to commit
it under another.
</p>
<p>The relation between sexual crimes and economic conditions is less direct; nevertheless
these also give evidence of the decisive influence of these conditions. We have called
attention to the four following points.
</p>
<p>First, there is a direct connection between the crime of adultery and the present
organization of society, which requires that the legal dissolution of a marriage should
be impossible or very difficult.
</p>
<p>Second, sexual crimes upon adults are committed especially by unmarried men; and since
the number of marriages depends in its <span class="pageNum" id="pb669">[<a href="#pb669">669</a>]</span>turn upon the economic situation, the connection is clear; and those who commit these
crimes are further almost exclusively illiterate, coarse, raised in an environment
almost without sexual morality, and regard the sexual life from the wholly animal
side.
</p>
<p>Third, the causes of sexual crime upon children are partly the same as those of which
we have been speaking, with the addition of prostitution.
</p>
<p>Fourth, alcoholism greatly encourages sexual assaults.
</p>
<p>As to the relation between crimes of vengeance and the present constitution of society,
we have noted that it produces conflicts without number; statistics have shown that
those who commit them are almost without exception poor and uncivilized, and that
alcoholism is among the most important causes of these crimes.
</p>
<p>Infanticide is caused in part by poverty, and in part by the opprobrium incurred by
the unmarried mother (an opprobrium resulting from the social utility of marriage).
</p>
<p>Political criminality comes solely from the economic system and its consequences.
</p>
<p>Finally, economic and social conditions are also important factors in the etiology
of degeneracy, which is in its turn a cause of crime.
</p>
<p>Upon the basis of what has gone before, we have a right to say that the part played
by economic conditions in criminality is preponderant, even decisive.
</p>
<p>This conclusion is of the highest importance for the prevention of crime. If it were
principally the consequence of innate human qualities (atavism, for example), the
pessimistic conclusion that crime is a phenomenon inseparably bound up with the social
life would be well founded. But the facts show that it is rather the optimistic conclusion
that we must draw, that where crime is the consequence of economic and social conditions,
we can combat it by changing those conditions.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>However important crime may be as a social phenomenon, however terrible may be the
injuries and the evil that it brings upon humanity, the development of society will
not depend upon the question as to what are the conditions which could restrain crime
or make it disappear, if possible; the evolution of society will proceed independently
of this question.
</p>
<p>What is the direction that society will take under these continual modifications?
This is not the place to treat fully of this subject. In my opinion the facts indicate
quite clearly what the direction will <span class="pageNum" id="pb670">[<a href="#pb670">670</a>]</span>be. The productivity of labor has increased to an unheard of degree, and will assuredly
increase in the future. The concentration of the means of production into the hands
of a few progresses continually; in many branches it has reached such a degree that
the fundamental principle of the present economic system, competition, is excluded,
and has been replaced by monopoly. On the other hand the working class is becoming
more and more organized, and the opinion is very generally held among working-men
that the causes of material and intellectual poverty can be eliminated only by having
the means of production held in common.
</p>
<p>Supposing that this were actually realized, what would be the consequences as regards
criminality? Let us take up this question for a moment. Although we can give only
personal opinions as to the details of such a society, the general outlines can be
traced with certainty.
</p>
<p>The chief difference between a society based upon the community of the means of production
and our own is that material poverty would be no longer known. Thus one great part
of economic criminality (as also one part of infanticide) would be rendered impossible,
and one of the greatest demoralizing forces of our present society would be eliminated.
And then, in this way those social phenomena so productive of crime, prostitution
and alcoholism, would lose one of their principal factors. Child labor and overdriving
would no longer take place, and bad housing, the source of much physical and moral
evil, would no longer exist.
</p>
<p>With material poverty there would disappear also that intellectual poverty which weighs
so heavily upon the proletariat; culture would no longer be the privilege of some,
but a possession common to all. The consequences of this upon criminality would be
very important, for we have seen that even in our present society with its numerous
conflicts, the members of the propertied classes, who have often but a veneer of civilization,
are almost never guilty of crimes of vengeance. There is the more reason to admit
that in a society where interests were not opposed, and where civilization was universal,
these crimes would be no longer present, especially since alcoholism also proceeds
in large part from the intellectual poverty of the poorer classes. And what is true
of crimes of vengeance, is equally true of sexual crimes in so far as they have the
same etiology.
</p>
<p>A large part of the economic criminality (and also prostitution to a certain extent)
has its origin in the cupidity excited by the present economic environment. In a society
based upon the community of <span class="pageNum" id="pb671">[<a href="#pb671">671</a>]</span>the means of production, great contrasts of fortune would, like commercial capital,
be lacking, and thus cupidity would find no food. These crimes will not totally disappear
so long as there has not been a redistribution of property according to the maxim,
“to each according to his needs”, something that will probably be realized, but not
in the immediate future.
</p>
<p>The changes in the position of woman which are taking place in our present society,
will lead, under this future mode of production, to her economic independence, and
consequently to her social independence as well. It is accordingly probable that the
criminality of woman will increase in comparison with that of man during the transition
period. But the final result will be the disappearance of the harmful effects of the
economic and social preponderance of man.
</p>
<p>As to the education of children under these new conditions it is difficult to be definite.
However, it is certain that the community will concern itself seriously with their
welfare. It will see to it that the children whose parents cannot or will not be responsible
for them, are well cared for. By acting in this way it will remove one of the most
important causes of crime. There is no doubt that the community will exercise also
a strict control over the education of children; it cannot be affirmed, however, that
the time will come when the children of a number of parents will be brought up together
by capable persons; this will depend principally upon the intensity that the social
sentiments may attain.
</p>
<p>As soon as the interests of all are no longer opposed to each other, as they are in
our present society, there will no longer be a question either of politics (“<span lang="la">a fortiori</span>” of political <i>crimes</i>) or of militarism.
</p>
<p>Such a society will not only remove the causes which now make men egoistic, but will
awaken, on the contrary, a strong feeling of altruism. We have seen that this was
already the case with the primitive peoples, where their economic interests were not
in opposition. In a larger measure this will be realized under a mode of production
in common, the interests of all being the same.
</p>
<p>In such a society there can be no question of crime properly so called. The eminent
criminologist, Manouvrier, in treating of the prevention of crime expresses himself
thus: “The maxim to apply is, act so that every man shall always have more interest
in being useful to his fellows than in harming them.” It is precisely in a society
where the community of the means of production has been realized that this maxim will
obtain its complete application. There will be crimes committed by pathological individuals,
but this will come rather <span class="pageNum" id="pb672">[<a href="#pb672">672</a>]</span>within the sphere of the physician than that of the judge. And then we may even reach
a state where these cases will decrease in large measure, since the social causes
of degeneracy will disappear, and procreation by degenerates be checked through the
increased knowledge of the laws of heredity and the increasing sense of moral responsibility.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“It is society that prepares the crime”, says the true adage of Quetelet. For all
those who have reached this conclusion, and are not insensible to the sufferings of
humanity, this statement is sad, but contains a ground of hope. It is sad, because
society punishes severely those who commit the crime which she has herself prepared.
It contains a ground of hope, since it promises to humanity the possibility of some
day delivering itself from one of its most terrible scourges.

a school of the poor in Berlin, the following composition: “You are going to the Christmas
fair without money, for your parents are poor. Your father is out of work. You find
a pocket book containing a five-mark piece. What do you do with it?” The children
had not been prepared for the subject and had received no indication of how they ought
to treat it. Only five per cent. of the girls said that they would return the money,
because they would pity the person who lost it, and <i>who might also be poor</i>. All the others among those who also wished to return the money (53%) had other motives.
Those who, on the contrary, wished to retain the money, wanted, <i>without exception</i>, to use it to give their parents things they needed. Who will still dare to say that
the children who wanted to keep the money (most of them believing in good faith that
they had a right to it) in order to give it to others, had feelings less social than
most of the rich who, without blushing, see the misery of the poor?&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e58575src" title="Return to note 401 in text.">↑</a></p>

prostitution exists exclusively. An examination of the two crimes separately gives

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
